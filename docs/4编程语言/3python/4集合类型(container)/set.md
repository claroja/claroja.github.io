```python
dataScientist = set(['Python', 'R', 'SQL', 'Git', 'Tableau', 'SAS'])
dataEngineer = set(['Python', 'Java', 'Scala', 'Git', 'SQL', 'Hadoop'])
```

### union
A union, denoted dataScientist `∪` dataEngineer, is the set of all values that are values of dataScientist, or dataEngineer, or both. 
```python
## set built-in function union
dataScientist.union(dataEngineer)
## Equivalent Result
dataScientist | dataEngineer
```
### intersection
An intersection of two sets dataScientist and dataEngineer, denoted dataScientist ∩ dataEngineer, is the set of all values that are values of both dataScientist and dataEngineer.

```python
## Intersection operation
dataScientist.intersection(dataEngineer)

## Equivalent Result
dataScientist & dataEngineer
```

### difference
A difference of two sets dataScientist and dataEngineer, denoted dataScientist \ dataEngineer, is the set of all values of dataScientist that are not values of dataEngineer.
```python
## Difference Operation
dataScientist.difference(dataEngineer)

## Equivalent Result
dataScientist - dataEngineer
```

### symmetric_difference
A symmetric difference of two sets dataScientist and dataEngineer, denoted dataScientist △ dataEngineer, is the set of all values that are values of exactly one of two sets, but not both.

```python
## Symmetric Difference Operation
dataScientist.symmetric_difference(dataEngineer)

## Equivalent Result
dataScientist ^ dataEngineer
```
