### 详情

1. 任务名称: Den of Evil
2. 触发: Starting Act I
3. 给予人: Akara
4. 目标地点: Location: Den of Evil (Blood Moor)
5. 奖励: 1个技能点, 重新分配技能
6. 优先级: 非必做任务

### 对话

1. 激活
    1. Akara: There is a place of great evil in the wilderness. Kashya’s Rogue scouts have informed me that a cave nearby is filled with shadowy creatures and horrors from beyond the grave. I fear that these creatures are massing for an attack against our encampment. If you are sincere about helping us, find the dark labyrinth and destroy the foul beasts. May the Great Eye watch over you.

2. 激活后

    1. Akara: I should add that many Rogue scouts have died in that horrible place. We cannot afford to lose any more. If you choose to enter that Den of Evil, you must do so alone.
    2. Charsi: The beasts from the cave have begun to roam throughout the countryside. You’d better be careful out there.
    3. Gheed: You’re a brave soul! I’d sooner thrust my sacred scepter into the foulest, carbuncular trull than set one boot into that cave.
    4. Kashya: The demons in that cave have claimed many of my finest archers. I wonder how you will fare!
    5. Warriv: One who seeks that cave, seeks death.

3. 中途返回

    1. Akara: Your task is not complete until you have killed all the demons in that cave.
    2. Charsi: You haven’t cleared the cave, yet? Do you need anything?
    3. Gheed: Demons still befouling that cave, huh? I think you might need a new weapon.
    4. Kashya: You’d better come through on this. Your reputation depends on it.
    5. Warriv: One who hesitates… does so with good reason.

4. 完成任务
    1. Akara: You have cleansed the Den of Evil. You’ve earned my trust and may yet restore my faith in humanity. Your reward is training in the skill of your choice.
    2. Charsi: You are truly brave and skillful… Akara was worried about you.
    3. Gheed: The only good demon is a dead one, I say. By the way, did you happen to find anything in that cave you’d like to sell?
    4. Kashya: Hmm. I’m surprised you survived that test, outlander. Go see Akara. She may reward you.
    5. Warriv: …That which does not kill you makes you stronger.

## Sisters’ Burial Grounds Details

### 详情

1. Quest Name: Sisters’ Burial Grounds
2. Triggered By: Entering the Cold Plains
3. Given by: Kashya the Rogue Leader
4. Location: Burial Grounds off the Cold Plains
5. Reward: One free Rogue mercenary from Kashya and option to hire more of them.
6. Quest Priority: Not mandatory, and most characters skip it.

### 对话

1. 任务激活

    1. Kashya: My Rogue scouts have just reported an abomination in the Monastery graveyard! Apparently, Andariel is not content to take only our living. Blood Raven, one of our finest captains in the battle against Diablo at Tristram, was also one of the first to be corrupted by Andariel. Now, you’ll find her in the Monastery graveyard raising our dead as zombies! We cannot abide this defilement! If you are truly our ally, you will help us destroy her.

2. 任务激活后

    1. Akara: Blood Raven fought valiantly against Diablo in the catacombs beneath Tristram… She was never quite the same afterwards. It is now obvious she brought an evil influence back with her.
    2. Charsi: Blood Raven was the leader of a Rogue band that once fought Diablo at Tristram.
    3. Gheed: I’m sorry… The undead are bad for trade. I have a strict no-return policy.
    4. Kashya: Death has done nothing to weaken Blood Raven’s combat skills. If anything, she’s more deadly than ever.
    5. Warriv: Hmmm…How can one kill what is already dead?

3. 中途返回
    1. Akara: If you fail to destroy Blood Raven, I fear that our Order will perish forever.
    2. Charsi: Akara felt something was wrong even before Andariel descended upon us. She feared that Blood Raven had stumbled upon some evil force beneath Tristram. I wish we had acted then…
    3. Gheed: I wonder if that old gossip, Melra, is among the undead? Oh, she had dirt on everybody.
    4. Kashya: Each moment you delay adds another undead Sister to Blood Raven’s army.
    5. Warriv: When the dead return to prey upon the living, it is a terror beyond understanding.

4. 完成任务
    1. Akara: Andariel must be made to pay for her sacrilege!
    2. Charsi: Kashya wishes to reward you for your defeat of Blood Raven. I thank you, too, even though Blood Raven was once my friend.
    3. Gheed: Some of those gals weren’t so nice the first time around.
    4. Kashya: I can hardly believe that you’ve defeated Blood Raven! Though she was once my closest friend, I pray that her tortured spirit remains banished forever. You have earned my respect, stranger… and the allegiance of the Rogues. I have placed several of my best warriors at your disposal.
    5. Warriv: You’ve done well, stranger. I hope all your efforts are worth it.


## The Search for Cain Details

### 详情

1. Quest Name: Rescue Cain
2. Triggered By: Reaching the Dark Wood
3. Given by: Akara
4. Location: Tristram, reached via the Stony Field
5. Reward: Free item identification from Deckard Cain and a ring from Akara. Ring Ilvl: Normal 7 (magical ring), Nightmare 28 (Rare Ring), Hell 49 (Rare Ring). The ring’s Ilvls are preset, it doesn’t matter what your Clvl is when you do this quest or get the reward.
6. Quest Priority: This is not a mandatory quest, but it’s useful to get free ID’s from Cain and the ring reward.


### 对话

1. 任务激活

    1. Akara: It is clear that we are facing an Evil difficult to comprehend, let alone combat. There is only one Horadrim sage, schooled in the most arcane history and lore, who could advise us… His name is Deckard Cain. You must go to Tristram and find him, my friend. I pray that he still lives.

2. 任务激活后

    1. Akara: Tristram is too far to journey by foot… Cain would likely be dead, when you arrived. However, there is a magical portal that will take you there instantly. To open it, one must stand within the circle of Cairn Stones and touch them in a certain order. The proper order can be found in the runes written on the bark of the Tree of Inifuss. You must find the sacred Tree of Inifuss and bring back its bark. I will translate the runes to unlock the Stones’ mystic pattern.
    2. Charsi: If you bring back the bark of Inifuss, Akara will tell you how to get to Tristram.
    3. Gheed: I would sooner micturate in a tankard of my own ale than journey to Tristram!
    4. Kashya: The bark of Inifuss holds mystical runes. Akara can translate them… into our revenge!
    5. Warriv: Months ago, I came across a few survivors from Tristram. They said that Cain had gone half-mad and could no longer distinguish fact from fantasy.

3. 中途返回
    1. Akara: How will you find Cain without going to Tristram? Finding the Tree of Inifuss is the first step on your journey.
    2. Charsi: Without the bark of Inifuss you can’t find Cain.
    3. Gheed: Barking up the wrong tree, huh? You’ll find it, just keep looking.
    4. Kashya: The Tree of Inifuss is hard to find, but you’ll know it when you see it.
    5. Warriv: He who seeks that which cannot be found must look inside himself for further guidance… or look harder!

4. 携带卷轴返回
    1. Akara: Ah, very good. I have translated the runes on this scroll. You must find the Cairn Stones and touch them in the order that I have written.
    2. Charsi: Get this to Akara. Only she can understand it.
    3. Gheed: Look, friend… I trade a lot of strange items, but I’m not going to start dealing in bark. Okay?
    4. Kashya: With this scroll you may open a portal back to Tristram. Only Akara can decipher its logic.
    5. Warriv: This looks like gibberish to me. Akara may know what to make of it.

5. （使用卷轴后）返回
    1. Akara: If he still lives, Deckard Cain may be in grave peril! You must hurry to Tristram before all is lost!
    2. Charsi: I have heard that Tristram is now in ruins! Without Cain I fear for the ruin of all of us.
    3. Gheed: I’m told that Tristram now resembles a mead hall… after a Barbarian wedding! I will wait here for your most glorious return.
    4. Kashya: Deckard Cain has crucial knowledge about the Evils we face. You must find him!
    5. Warriv: It is too dangerous to travel to Tristram. I won’t be leaving here until the way is clear!

6. 完成任务
    1. Akara: You have risked your life to rescue Cain. For that we thank you. We must seek his counsel immediately.
    2. Charsi: Akara wishes to reward you for your bravery in returning Deckard Cain.
    3. Deckard Cain: 
        - Rescue: …I thank you, friend, for coming to my aid.
        - Success: As a token of my gratitude, I will identify items for you at no charge.
        - Failure: Oh… Blessings on the Rogues! They finally rescued me from that cursed place!
    4. Gheed: Ah, Cain is here… another customer. I haven’t been this pleased since a love-starved maiden let down a bit more than her hair.
    5. Kashya: Again, you amaze me, outlander. The Sisterhood is grateful to you for delivering Cain to us. I believe Akara has something to tell you.
    6. Warriv: Only a brave adventurer could return with Deckard Cain. Akara has a reward for your valor. 

7. 额外的对话
    1. Deckard Cain

        Regrettably, I could do nothing to prevent the disaster which devastated Tristram. It would appear that our greatest fears have come to pass. Diablo, the Lord of Terror, has once again been set loose upon the world!
        As you know, some time ago Diablo was slain beneath Tristram. And when our hero emerged triumphant from the labyrinth beneath town, we held a grand celebration that lasted several days.
        Yet, as the weeks passed, our hero became increasingly aloof. He kept his distance from the rest of the townsfolk and seemed to lapse into a dark, brooding depression. I thought that perhaps his ordeal had been so disturbing that he simply could not put it out of his mind.
        The hero seemed more tormented every passing day. I remember he awoke many times — screaming in the night — always something about ‘the East’.
        One day, he simply left. And shortly thereafter Tristram was attacked by legions of foul demons. Many were slain, and the demons left me to die in that cursed cage.
        I believe now that Tristram’s hero was that Dark Wanderer who passed this way before the Monastery fell.
        I fear even worse, my friend… I fear that Diablo has taken possession of the hero who sought to slay him. If true, Diablo will become more powerful than ever before.
        You must stop him or all will be lost.


## The Forgotten Tower

### 详情

1. Quest Name: The Forgotten Tower
2. Triggered By: Reading the Moldy Tome, found in the Stony Field
3. Location: Find the Forgotten Tower ruins in the Black Marsh
4. Reward: Killing the Countess on the fifth level of the tower releases dozens of stacks of gold and numerous items from the magical chest.
5. Quest Priority: This is not a mandatory quest, and most characters skip it. It became more popular with v1.08, as the Countess began to drop a Rune nearly every time.



### 对话

1. 任务激活

    1. Moldy Tome: …And so it came to pass that the Countess, who once bathed in the rejuvenating blood of a hundred virgins, was buried alive… And her castle in which so many cruel deeds took place fell rapidly into ruin. Rising over the buried dungeons in that god-forsaken wilderness, a solitary tower, like some monument to Evil, is all that remains. The Countess’ fortune was believed to be divided among the clergy, although some say that more remains unfound, still buried alongside the rotting skulls that bear mute witness to the inhumanity of the human creature.

2. 任务激活后

    1. Akara: The dangers there are not solely architectural. Once inside that wretched place, many succumb to a vile miasma.
    2. Charsi: That old tower is as rotten on the inside as it appears on the outside. I heard that several Sisters came to a gruesome end when a stairwell collapsed on them.
    3. Deckard Cain: That tower marks a place of danger. There is an epic poem about it… How much sorrow one can stand was tested there.
    4. Gheed: The only wealth you’re likely to find there is a wealth of vermin.
    5. Kashya: The tome speaks of treasure. Yet, all we have found are death, delirium, and disappointment.
    6. Warriv: Rumors of treasure are no different from rumors of any other kind. They hold false promise to those who should know better.

3. 中途返回
    1. Akara: There is no more I can tell you about that ancient tower.
    2. Charsi: You’re not ready to give up, are you?
    3. Deckard Cain: Quickly in and quickly out is all the advice I can give you.
    4. Gheed: Guess what! I’ve named a boil on my ass after you. It, too, bothers me every time I sit down.
    5. Kashya: Have you suddenly lost your taste for wealth?
    6. Warriv: Better an empty pocket than a full grave.

4. 完成任务
    1. Akara: I thought the stories of treasure in the tower were nothing but lies. I am glad you found something of value in that death-trap. Would that our Sisters had been so fortunate.
    2. Charsi: Those riches will serve you well on the long road ahead.
    3. Deckard Cain: Well done, my friend. Courage and opportunity together have created in you a kind of alchemy.
    4. Gheed: Warriv’s advice is like corpse gas; it befouls the air for a moment and then it disappears.
    5. Kashya: Your rewards are well-earned. To us, the tower was nothing more than a headstone looming over a long forgotten grave.
    6. Warriv: Remember. Wealth is as insubstantial as a cloud and passes as quickly. Ignore Gheed. All that twitters is not bold. 


## Tools of the Trade Details

### 详情

1. Quest Name: Tools of the Trade
2. Triggered By: Reaching the Monastery Gates
3. Given by: Charsi the Blacksmith
4. Location: The Smith’s room in the Barracks
5. Reward: Charsi will imbue an item for you. This means take any normal item and make it into a Rare with random stats, based on your Clvl.
6. Quest Priority: Not a mandatory quest, but the reward is valuable.

### 对话

1. 任务激活

    1. Charsi: When I fled the Monastery, I left behind the Horadric Malus, my enchanted smithing hammer. If you can retrieve it for me, I’ll use its magic to strengthen your equipment.

2. 任务激活后

    1. Akara: The retrieval of the Horadric Malus is not without risk. Our Monastery is filled with voracious hellspawn. You’d best be careful, my friend.
    2. Charsi: The Monastery can confuse even those who know it well. Stay alert in there.
    3. Deckard Cain: The Malus was forged and enchanted by the ancient Horadric Mages during the Sin Wars. When their union dissolved, the Malus was entrusted to the Sisterhood guarding the pass into the East.
    4. Gheed: Charsi talks of nothing anymore, but this Horadric Malus. Between you and her my ears need a rest. Just find it and bring it back quickly.
    5. Kashya: Charsi is wasting her time and talents using an inferior hammer! Had she the Horadric Malus, she could make the steel sing and craft you a suit of armor as impenetrable as the Great Eye.
    6. Warriv: Just as an archer needs bow and arrow, or a draughtsman pen and paper, so Charsi needs the Horadric Malus with which to ply her trade.

3. 中途返回
    1. Akara: If you can’t carry out this quest, how will you face the greater evils ahead?
    2. Charsi: The Malus is a Horadric artifact of great power. Please bring it back.
    3. Deckard Cain: The Malus has eluded you so far. Well, search thoroughly in the Barracks… That is where the Rogues kept their forge.
    4. Gheed: I have heard that you bear us no Malus.
    5. Kashya: To do battle with Andariel requires more than thick skin and a strong will. You’ll want armor and weaponry forged with the hammer’s enchantments.
    6. Warriv: What better opportunity to show your mettle?

4. 完成任务
    1. Akara: Well done, my friend. But remember, the return of the Horadric Malus is but one step in reclaiming the Monastery.
    2. Charsi: Oh! Thanks so much for returning the Horadric Malus! I will now imbue one of your items with magical powers.
    3. Deckard Cain: The magical effects imbued by the Malus are impossible to predict, but are always to the good.
    4. Gheed: I guess it’s too late to take back some of the names I called you.
    5. Kashya: Now that the Horadric Malus is back in our possession, we shall use it to deliver a great blow against the Evil which torments this land.
    6. Warriv: I am glad the hammer has returned and you with it.


## Sisters to the Slaughter


### 详情

1. Quest Name: Sisters to the Slaughter
2. Triggered By: Finishing the Malus Quest, or by reaching Catacombs level three
3. Given by: Cain the Elder
4. Location: Andariel’s Throne Room, Catacombs level four
5. Reward: You may travel with Warriv’s caravan to Lut Gholein and Act II.
6. Quest Priority: Mandatory, you must kill Andariel to advance to Act II.

### 对话

1. 任务激活

    1. Deckard Cain: It is certain that we face the demon queen, Andariel, who has corrupted the Rogue Sisterhood and defiled their ancestral Monastery. This does not bode well for us, my friend. Ancient Horadric texts record that Andariel and the other Lesser Evils once overthrew the three Prime Evils — Diablo, Mephisto and Baal — banishing them from Hell to our world. Here, they caused mankind untold anguish and suffering before they were finally bound within the Soulstones. Andariel’s presence here could mean that the forces of Hell are once again aligned behind Diablo and his Brothers. If this is true, then I fear for us all. You must kill her before the Monastery becomes a permanent outpost of Hell and the way east lost forever.

2. 任务激活后

    1. Akara: Andariel has desecrated all we hold dear. She must not be permitted to serve Diablo. Destroy her! Her corruption of our Order must be undone!
    2. Charsi: Send Andariel back to the Hell she came from!
    3. Deckard Cain: Diablo is heading east for some foul purpose. And the only passage east is through the Monastery gate. Obviously, Diablo summoned Andariel to block any pursuit. For her part Andariel hopes to win Diablo’s favor… the lesser demons are always vying for positions of power within the unholy hierarchy!
    4. Gheed: You’re going after Andariel? … One of my wagon wheels is in need of repair. I’ll be under the wagon, if I’m needed.
    5. Kashya: I can imagine a thousand different ways to kill Andariel. You need only choose one.
    6. Warriv: The mapmakers tell us the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Our way east is a line that runs through Andariel’s stronghold, the Monastery.

3. 中途返回
    1. Akara: You have done much to help us, but I sense that this has only fueled Andariel’s fury. She will not stop until we are all dead. You must kill Andariel before her army can gain the upper hand.
    2. Charsi: If you are the hero that you seem to be, now is the time to prove it.
    3. Deckard Cain: It is clear that Andariel is acting on behalf of Diablo to prevent anyone from following him eastward. Her defeat would allow you to continue the pursuit. Ancient lore has it that while Andariel was spawned in the Burning Hells, she is not fond of fire.
    4. Gheed: Have you stumbled upon that Demon Queen, yet? I hear she’s quite the beauty… as far as Maidens of Anguish go, that is.
    5. Kashya: Deckard Cain has important information about Andariel.
    6. Warriv: May I remind you that my caravan can only go east, if the Monastery is cleansed?

4. 完成任务
    1. Akara: Finally, we may rejoice! We owe you a debt we can never repay. I only hope that in time we will be able to rebuild our Order. All our thanks go with you, my friend.
    2. Charsi: You’ll probably go east now… It was good to know you. I hope you’ll come back if you ever need anything.
    3. Deckard Cain: This is a great victory indeed, but many more battles await. I will accompany you on your journey, lending what assistance I can… Remember… Diablo is still out there, seeking something in the desert. I’m afraid that this nightmare will not end until you find what it is that he seeks.
    4. Gheed: I’m going to party like it’s 999!
    5. Kashya: Andariel’s death brings about renewed life for us all. We mourn the loss of our dear Sisters, but at least now we can get on with our lives. I… may have misjudged you, outlander. You are a true hero and testament to the noble spirit which has inspired our Order for generations. Fare well… my friend.
    6. Warriv: The caravan is prepared. We may now journey eastward to Lut Gholein.
