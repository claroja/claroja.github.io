1. Triggered By: Reaching Act Five
1. Given by: Larzuk the Blacksmith

### 对话

1. 任务激活

    1. Larzuk: If you’re here to defeat Baal, you must prove it! As we speak, Harrogath is under siege by Baal’s demons. Catapults rain death just outside the town walls. Baal himself travels up the sacred mountain, having left in charge here one of his most vicious generals, Shenk the Overseer. A ruthless taskmaster, he lashes his own minions into suicidal frenzies on the battlefield. If you wish to prove yourself to us, destroy the monster, Shenk, that commands those infernal catapults outside Harrogath. If you manage to do this, return to me.

2. 任务激活后

    1. Anya: You’ve proven your skill at rescuing fair maidens…but how are you at killing vicious beasts?
    2. Deckard Cain: I believe that stopping the siege on Harrogath is the only way for you to earn the trust of these people.
    3. Larzuk: Uh…Did I mention there were catapults?
    4. Malah: Qual-Kehk and his men have been fighting to break the siege for some time. Where many have failed, you may succeed.
    5. Nihlathak: After so many have died, who are you to think you can accomplish what our proud warriors could not?
    6. Qual-Kehk: About to face Shenk the Overseer and stop the siege, are you? You should ask Malah to perform your last rites before you go, stranger.

3. 中途返回

    1. Anya: Those demons have been out there since before your arrival. Can you do nothing to stop them? Your task is a simple one, warrior. Find Shenk and destroy him.
    2. Deckard Cain: I understand your reluctance, but now is the time to strike.
    3. Larzuk: What’s the matter, hero? Questioning your fortitude? I know we are.
    4. Malah: This may not be very encouraging, but you have fared better than the others who passed through those gates. In regards to Shenk the Overseer, remember: a general is nothing without his men.
    5. Nihlathak: What are you still doing here? I thought you were going off to die. Go…Be quick about it.
    6. Qual-Kehk: So, you still live. You’re either quick or a coward.

4. 完成任务

    1. Anya: I was starting to wonder how long it would take you to stop those beasts. Good job.
    2. Deckard Cain: Those catapults were like nothing I have ever seen before. You have prevailed against Shenk, my friend, but Baal is still far ahead of you.
    3. Larzuk: You’re an even greater warrior than I expected…Sorry for underestimating you. As a token of my appreciation, I will craft sockets into an item of your choosing, and from now on, you’ll get the best price for all my wares.
    4. Malah: Oh…At last, the siege is ended. You truly are an angel. I thank you.
    5. Nihlathak: Ending the siege does not earn immediate respect, outsider. Respect only comes with sacrifice — something I’m sure you know nothing of.
    6. Qual-Kehk: So…You managed to stop the siege. You are more powerful than I gave you credit for. You have rightfully earned my respect. 





## Rescue on Mount Arreat

### 详情

1. Quest Name: Rescue on Mt. Arreat
2. Triggered by: Entering the Frigid Highlands.
3. Given by: Qual-Kehk
4. Location: Frigid Highlands
5. Reward: Ability to hire Barbarian Mercs and Tal, Ral, Ort runes.
6. Quest Priority: Not mandatory, but has a nice reward.



### 对话

1. 任务激活

    1. Qual-Kehk: My concerns have turned to my men taken prisoner on the battlefield by Baal’s demons. I hate to think what’s happened to them. As you journey up the mountain, keep your eyes open for my soldiers and bring them back to me if you can.

2. 任务激活后

    1. Anya: If those men are being treated like I was, you must find them. They won’t survive much longer.
    2. Deckard Cain: I know firsthand that captivity is a sad fate for a man. Find them quickly.
    3. Larzuk: I crafted the swords and armor for Qual-Kehk’s men. They were like brothers to me. I can’t imagine the pain they must be suffering. Save them if you can!
    4. Malah: Qual-Kehk’s men have been imprisoned for some time. They are certain to be tired and weak. You must protect them once you free them.
    5. Nihlathak: You have proven you can take life, warrior, but can you save it as well?
    6. Qual-Kehk: Those of my men fortunate enough to escape on their own told me that they were held captive in the highlands and plateaus.

3. 中途返回

    1. Anya: Well, you found me on the mountain; I’m sure you’ll find them too.
    2. Deckard Cain: If you are having trouble finding Qual-Kehk’s soldiers, you should talk to Malah. She healed those who made it back before. Perhaps she would have some advice.
    3. Larzuk: As a kid, I used to play soldier among the barricades on the mountain. There’s no easy way through that maze of walls.
    4. Malah: Soldiers who made it back told of a system of barricades placed among the mountain passes. They said that is where the prisoners are held.
    5. Nihlathak: Did you ever stop to think why these demons are capturing Qual-Kehk’s men? Why they are attacking us? Have you considered what Baal wants with the mountain? No. You’ve not. You have no idea what you are dealing with.
    6. Qual-Kehk: They say that discretion, not procrastination, is the better part of valor.
    7. Qual-Kehk (after freeing the first men): More of my men are still alive out there. I am certain of it! Find them. Free them from their cages and bring them back to me.

4. 完成任务

    1. Anya: I’m sure those men appreciate the freedom you gave them…as much as I do.
    2. Deckard Cain: You’ve become a hero to this town, my friend. The shadows have lifted ever since you brought the Light to Harrogath.
    3. Larzuk: Since your arrival, Cain has spoken of your deeds in the Southern Kingdoms, defeating both Mephisto and Diablo. At first, I scoffed at his tales, but I’m finding them more believable with every passing day.
    4. Malah: You have inspired the people in this town — not only those you rescued, but those you’ve helped in other ways as well.
    5. Nihlathak: So. You brought the lost sheep home to the shepherd. Well done.
    6. Qual-Kehk: Thank you for rescuing my men. They have spoken well of your bravery in battle. Perhaps there is hope for us after all. If you wish, you may hire some of my mercenaries that you saved. And please…take this set of runes. I had been saving them for a socketed shield, but I think you’ll make better use of them. Be sure to set them in the right order for their fullest effect. 



## Prison of Ice

### 详情

1. Quest Name: Prison of Ice
2. Triggered by: Entering Arreat Plateau (surface area #3)
3. Given by: Malah
4. Location: Frozen River
5. Rewards: +10 to all resistance, Rare (usually) class-specific item.
6. Quest Priority: Not mandatory, but very nice rewards.

### 对话

1. 任务激活

    1. Malah: There is a matter which I hesitate to share, but I believe you are the only one who can help me now. Anya, the young alchemist and daughter to one of our slain Elders, has been missing for some time. She is a strong, crafty woman with a spirit like no other. One night, just before your arrival, I overheard her and Nihlathak arguing about her father’s death. The next morning she was gone. Nihlathak has his own tale as to where she went and why. Don’t believe him! I fear he is at the root of her disappearance. Please, if you can, search for Anya and bring her back to us. She’ll know what to do about Nihlathak.

2. 任务激活后

    1. Deckard Cain: I would listen to Malah. Nihlathak speaks with a venomous tongue and acts as if the entire weight of this town rests upon his shoulders. Perhaps there is more going on here than we know.
    2. Larzuk: Anya is an amazing alchemist, especially for her young age. As long as I’ve known her, she’s never let anything stop her from pursuing what she believed in. I wouldn’t doubt that Nihlathak is involved. Ever since her father died, they haven’t gotten along.
    3. Malah: When you talk to Nihlathak, be careful. There is no telling what he will say or do.
    4. Nihlathak: Anya! Who have you been talking to? Likely it was that meddling Malah. Well, I’ll tell you what really happened. Anya came to me for guidance, after receiving a vision that her mother and younger brother were trapped in the lands beyond the Ice Caves. She had decided to go rescue them. I told her that her quest was a foolish one and that she would be safer staying within the city walls. However, she is a willful girl and would not listen to me. The next morning, she was gone. No one is more distraught than I over losing her. However, if you feel the need to be Malah’s errand child, I won’t try to stop you.
    5. Qual-Kehk: Anya’s father, Aust, was our wisest Elder. He was killed along with the other Elders who erected the ward that protects this city. The ward has kept Baal’s demons out of Harrogath, but at a costly sacrifice. Nihlathak, on the other hand, was the only Elder to escape the demons. Somehow, he alone managed to find sanctuary, while the others died around him. Ever since that day, Nihlathak and Anya have been at odds.

3. 中途返回

    1. Deckard Cain: Nihlathak’s story does sound reasonable, considering what I’ve heard about Anya. However, the best lies are often hidden within truth.
    2. Larzuk: As the daughter of Elder Aust, Anya is the only person, besides Nihlathak, who has any real knowledge of Mount Arreat’s secrets. I’d hate to see our fate in the hands of Nihlathak alone.
    3. Malah: If it were anyone else, I would assume her dead. However, Anya is not so easily beaten. I know she must be alive.
    4. Nihlathak: Look, I’ve told you! She’s dead! If you knew what was good for you, you’d concentrate your efforts on saving Harrogath — not on lost causes like Anya.
    5. Qual-Kehk: It seems like everyone feels Nihlathak played a part in Anya’s disappearance. Why would he do such a thing?

4. 找到安雅后返回

    1. Anya: Hero. Nihlathak did this to me! If you’ve come to help me, my only hope lies with Malah. Please…Tell her you’ve found me…
    2. Anya (after rescue): Meet me in town! Hurry!
    3. Deckard Cain: Goodness! Anya frozen by that fallen Barbarian, Nihlathak…Perhaps Malah can help you where I cannot.
    4. Larzuk: Poor Anya! I should’ve known Nihlathak was a traitor… If you find him alive, kill him for me!
    5. Malah: So! That snake Nihlathak was behind Anya’s disappearance…and he trapped her with a freezing curse. Here. Take this potion to Anya and give it to her. That should release her.
    6. Qual-Kehk: The snake has slipped our grasp! While you were gone, Nihlathak disappeared. I’ll bet Anya knows how to track him down.

5. 完成任务

    1. Anya: Thank you, hero, for rescuing me. To show my personal gratitude, I give you this. I had it custom-made for you by Larzuk.
    2. Deckard Cain: For one so young, Anya commands great respect. Now that she is here, I will make it a point to talk to her about Mount Arreat. You should do the same.
    3. Larzuk: I never liked Nihlathak, but I never suspected that he’d betray us! I just can’t understand how an Elder could do such a thing.
    4. Malah: Thank you so much for bringing Anya back to us. I have devised this spell to increase your resistances as a token of my thanks. I know it isn’t much, but I hope you find it helpful. Please go talk to Anya. She has urgent news concerning Nihlathak.
    5. Qual-Kehk: Your rescue of Anya was quite an accomplishment. 


## Betrayal of Harrogath

### 详情

1. Quest Name: Betrayal of Harrogath
2. Triggered by: Rescuing Anya (Quest Three).
3. Given by: Anya
4. Location: Red Portal to Nihlathak’s Temple, then down into a three level dungeon.
5. Rewards: Your name on an item from Anya.
6. Quest Priority: Not required, and extremely deadly on Nightmare and Hell. We recommend you skip it past Normal, especially if you are Hardcore. Contrary to popular opinion, it is possible to complete this quest simply for the good XP and loot while still keeping Anya’s red portal to Pindleskin‘s Garden open for future Pindle-runs, so long as you remember: Don’t activate the Halls of Pain waypoint. Otherwise the red portal closes permanently the next time you quit, robbing the Pindle-run of its future usefulness.

### 对话

1. 任务激活

    1. Anya: Nihlathak told me he struck a deal with Baal to protect Harrogath. In exchange for the demon’s mercy, the misguided fool plans to give Baal the Relic of the Ancients, our most holy totem! Doing so will allow Baal to enter Mount Arreat unchallenged by the Ancients. I tried to stop Nihlathak, but he imprisoned me in that icy tomb. Nihlathak must be stopped before he dooms the whole world. As much as I would love to strangle the life out of him, I’m afraid I haven’t the strength. You must go to his lair through this portal I’ve opened, kill him, and then bring back the Relic of the Ancients. Stop Nihlathak from destroying what we have striven for eons to protect.

2. 任务激活后

    1. Anya: As noble as Nihlathak’s intentions are, nothing can excuse his actions.
    2. Deckard Cain: Regretfully, I know very little about this Relic. However, if what the others say is true, then Baal must not gain possession of it. Stop Nihlathak…before all is lost.
    3. Larzuk: Now, rescuing Anya — that’s good. Talking to me while Nihlathak hands over the Relic to Baal — uh…that’s bad!
    4. Malah: My worst fear has come true. Nihlathak has gone mad. You must stop him, before he gives the Relic to the Lord of Destruction!
    5. Qual-Kehk: I saw Nihlathak leave town just before you found Anya. He must be held accountable for his criminal deeds. Find him and bring him back, if you can. Likely, he won’t come willingly, and you’ll be forced to kill him. So be it.

3. 中途返回

    1. Anya: Nihlathak is a traitor! If Baal gets the Relic, he shall enter the mountain and wreak havoc there! I cannot believe that Nihlathak would give the Relic to Baal in any kind of trade. He’s truly insane if he believes that he can deal with the Lord of Destruction.
    2. Deckard Cain: Ohh…This is a truly horrible turn of events. I know it seems you have always been one step behind, my friend. But look at it this way…You have evil on the run.
    3. Larzuk: …What’s there to talk about? Kill Nihlathak!
    4. Malah: Nihlathak was never the kindest man. But for him to betray the whole world… Ahh…Where shall his soul finally rest?
    5. Qual-Kehk: My advice is to go in quick and hit hard. Nihlathak can’t be half as tough as the beasts you’ve faced out there.

4. 完成任务

    1. Anya: You have stopped Nihlathak, but he didn’t have the Relic! He must have already given it to Baal. Now, Baal will not be tested when he reaches Arreat’s summit. …Damn Nihlathak! I do thank you for trying, though. Please, allow me to honor your courage by magically inscribing your name onto an item of your choosing. It’s the least I can do.
    2. Deckard Cain: Beware! Baal grows stronger with every passing moment.
    3. Larzuk: Hmmm…What does Baal plan to do inside Mount Arreat?
    4. Malah: So, the Relic is lost. Do not dwell on failures past. It is your future that matters more.
    5. Qual-Kehk: Nihlathak was a vile demon that shall find his home among the tortured minions of Hell! You battled the Darkness without fear. I laud your skill and courage. 


## Rite of Passage

### 详情


1. Quest Name: Rite of Passage
2. Triggered by: Reaching the Ancient’s Way triggers Qual-Kehk to speak of it. Or you can go straight to the Arreat Summit and click on the altar.
3. Given by: Qual-Kehk
4. Location: Arreat Summit
5. Reward: Bonus to your Experience. Normal: 1.4 million, Clvl 20 required. Nightmare: 20 million, Clvl 40 required. Hell: 40 million, Clvl 60 required. This bonus is not cut like experience from monster kills when you are past Clvl 75, so this quest is always a huge boost, but if you can save it (borrow a portal to the Worldstone Keep) until you are Clvl 80 or 85 it’s even more valuable.
6. Quest Priority: Not mandatory if you can get a portal inside the Worldstone Keep from another player, otherwise you must defeat the Guardians to get in. The reward is enormous though, so we recommend you do it.

### 对话

1. 任务激活

    1. Qual-Kehk: Every time I hear of you, warrior, your deeds become more legendary. But take heed. You are approaching the very summit of Mount Arreat. I have never dared venture there. It is sacred — our most holy place. The legends say it is guarded by the Ancient Ones, who block the path of all who are unworthy. Your reputation here does not matter…It will be the Ancients who determine your worthiness. Good luck.

2. 任务激活后

    1. Anya: You wouldn’t have to test yourself against the Ancients if it weren’t for Nihlathak’s treachery. He was a fool and deserves to suffer for eternity.
    2. Deckard Cain: A test of mettle is a fitting rite of passage for a Barbarian hero.
    3. Larzuk: Every night, I’ve prayed to the Ancients to bring us peace…and now you must fight them. Huh…Who shall I pray to now, warrior?
    4. Malah: By reaching the summit, you cease being just a simple warrior. When you come back, you will be far more.
    5. Qual-Kehk: The Ancients are not our enemies. Remember that! They are our ancestors — our gods.

3. 中途返回

    1. Anya: Look. I must apologize. I feel responsible for your current struggle. If I had only stopped Nihlathak from giving Baal the Relic, you would not have to fight those ghosts.
    2. Deckard Cain: We have come too far to be defeated now, my friend. I have seen you complete many difficult quests. Though this may be your greatest trial, it is not beyond your reach.
    3. Larzuk: You’ve walked on the burial grounds of our greatest ancestors. I’m not sure whether I should bow before you or revile you for committing sacrilege. Tread lightly when you walk with gods.
    4. Malah: Do not doubt yourself. I believe you are worthy to pass through the Ancients’ gates, but you must believe, as well.
    5. Qual-Kehk: I warned you! The Ancients are not like the demons you’re accustomed to fighting.

4. 其他角色（远古者）

    1. Ancients: We are the spirits of the Nephalem, the Ancient Ones. We have been chosen to guard sacred Mount Arreat, wherein the Worldstone rests. Few are worthy to stand in its presence; fewer still can comprehend its true purpose. Before you enter, you must defeat us.

5. 完成任务

    1. Anya: You stand before me a worthy hero — and on you rests the last hope of our people. Bear it well, warrior.
    2. Deckard Cain: You have proven yourself to these people. They look to you as their warrior, their champion.
    3. Larzuk: The Ancients have honored you, and in turn, so do we. I have no remaining doubts about you, now.
    4. Malah: I knew the Ancients would find you worthy of Mount Arreat’s secrets. Now, stop Baal before he destroys all that is sacred.
    5. Qual-Kehk: Besting the Ancients in battle is a mighty feat indeed. I hope this means you’re ready to battle Baal. 

## Eve of Destruction

### 详情
1. Quest Name: Eve of Destruction
2. Triggered by: Defeating the Ancients (Quest Five)
3. Given by: Qual-Kehk, or when you reach the Throne of Destruction level.
4. Location: Throne of Destruction.
5. Rewards: Baal’s item drop, complete the Act, view final cinematic, gain a title.
6. Quest Priority: Mandatory to finish the Act and advance to the next difficulty level.


### 对话

1. 激活

    Once Tyrael has delivered this rather unsettling message, he opens a red portal. The screen shakes and keeps shaking worse and worse, and chunks of crystal keep spinning by, moving up or down. When you click on the portal you pop to the new Congratulations screen, and after that view the final cinematic. In it Tyrael does indeed destroy the WorldStone, which is somewhat of a surprise. Many people suspected from the Act Five info during the beta (which did not include the new Cinematics) that it wasn’t really Tyrael, and was instead a trick of Baal’s, or by one of the other Lesser Evils, such as Belial, to get control of the Worldstone themselves. Apparently the game plot was much more straight-forward than some of us suspected.

    If you’ve already killed Baal, Tyrael doesn’t appear, and you don’t get the red portal.



    You are a worthy hero! We augment your skill and grant you entry to the interior of Mount Arreat, wherein lies the Worldstone.
    Beware. You will not be alone. Baal the Lord of Destruction is already inside.
    The Archangel Tyrael has always been our benefactor, but even he cannot help us now. For Baal blocks Tyrael’s spiritual presence from entering the chamber of the Worldstone. Only you, mortal, have the power to defeat Baal now.
    Baal threatens the Worldstone — and through it, the mortal realm, itself. You must stop him before he gains full control of the sacred stone. With it under his control, Baal could shatter the boundaries between this world and the Burning Hells, thus allowing the hordes of the Prime Evils to pour forth into the mortal realm like an unstoppable tide!
    If you are weak, the world as you know it could be lost forever. You must NOT fail!

1. 中途返回

    1. Anya: Baal has blocked Tyrael from entering the Worldstone Chamber? This truly has become a battle against Hell. Whether or not it was the Heavens’ decree, this is your fight now — your destiny.
    2. Deckard Cain: Remember this. Baal once possessed Tal Rasha, one of the most powerful of the ancient Horadrim. Your battles with Mephisto and Diablo will pale in comparison to your battle with Baal. The Lord of Destruction aided by Tal Rasha’s knowledge…The mountain itself will tremble when you clash.
    3. Larzuk: I may be just an armorer, but I know this…Baal plans to destroy the world with the secrets contained in that mountain. It doesn’t take a genius to know he has to be stopped.
    4. Malah: You knew it would eventually come down to this. Kill Baal! Finish the game!
    5. Qual-Kehk: You have ventured to a place beyond legend. You rush to face an evil few can even imagine. Be careful, my friend, and may the Light watch over you.

2. 完成任务

    1. Anya: You have done the impossible, hero. Your defeat of the last of the three Prime Evils is a great victory for the Light. Strange that you say that the Worldstone must be destroyed. The prophecies said nothing about that. Perhaps all we have fought for will be lost…or perhaps we’ll never need fight again!
    2. Deckard Cain: I knew in time you would defeat Baal. You have done everything you set out to do, my friend. Ever since you rescued me from Tristram, I have believed in you. It has been a supreme honor to aid you along the way. So…The Worldstone was corrupted by Baal. And now Tyrael must destroy it. Worry not. Through whatever lies ahead I have faith that the Light will guide us both. Go, now, back to the Worldstone chamber, and enter the portal Tyrael has opened for you.
    3. Larzuk: The Ancients themselves will envy our songs about you. Please, don’t forget about us! Farewell, my friend.
    4. Malah: If Tyrael says the Worldstone must be destroyed, then it must. We cannot let Baal’s corruption prevail! The world will change, true — but who is to say it isn’t for the better?
    5. Qual-Kehk: The destruction of the Worldstone does not bode well for our world. But I’ll try not to worry… After all, we have warriors like you fighting for us and for the Light. Farewell!
    6. Tyrael: I am impressed, mortal. You have overcome the greatest challenge this world has ever faced and defeated the last of the Prime Evils. However, we are too late to save the Worldstone. Baal’s destructive touch has corrupted it completely. Given enough time, the Worldstone’s energies will drain away and the barriers between the worlds will shatter — the powers of Hell will flood into this…Sanctuary…and eradicate your people and everything you’ve labored to build. Therefore, I must destroy the corrupted Worldstone before the powers of Hell take root. This act will change your world forever — with consequences even I cannot foresee. However, it is the only way to ensure mankind’s survival. Go now, mortal. I have opened a portal that will lead you to safety. May the Eternal Light shine upon you and your descendants for what you’ve done this day. The continued survival of mankind is your legacy! Above all else, you have earned a rest from this endless battle.
