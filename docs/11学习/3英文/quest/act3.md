### 对话

1. 任务激活

    1. Alkor (Unused): Who has not dreamt of immortality? One man is rumored to have done more than merely dream. Find the Golden Bird of Ku Y’leh and you might find the secret to everlasting life.

2. 任务激活后

    1. Alkor (Unused): Many alchemists believe that Ku Y’leh magic elixir bonded with his body before his death. His ashes are therefore considered to be very rare, highly potent, alchemical ingredients. If I could procure the ashes, I would create a potion which could defy death itself.
    2. Asheara (Unused): Legend has it that those who murdered Ku Y’leh for its secrets wound out losing its coveted ashes. They died of old age and madness.
    3. Hratli (Unused): Ku Y’leh was a powerful sage who was rumored to have brewed a potion of immortality. In an ironic twist of fate, he was murdered before his potent elixir could take effect.
    4. Natalya (Unused): Don’t tell me you believe in all of that ‘life after death’ nonsense. You should be more concerned with avoiding death than making plans for after it finds you.
    5. Ormus (Unused): Ku Y’leh, in searching for immortal youth, found only an early death. His apprentices, seeking to live forever, burned his body in order to derive benefit from his ashes.

3. 携带翡翠雕像返回
    1. Alkor (Unused): Remember, Ku Y’leh ashes are stored within the statuette of the Golden Bird. The Bird is worth a great deal to the one who can locate it.
    2. Asheara: Only Deckard Cain can make sense of this.
    3. Deckard Cain: Back in Lut Gholein Meshif told me he had a fondness for jade figurines. On his trading voyages he collected an odd assortment of such small statues. I would show him your figurine.
    4. Hratli (Unused): Well, you’ve got something there. It isn’t the golden bird.
    5. Meshif: Praise you! That jade figurine will complete the set I was collecting. Here! I’ve had this statuette of a golden bird for years, but I consider it a fair exchange.

4. 携带金鸟返回
    1. Alkor: Ah, the Golden Bird of Ku Y’leh. Thank you, my friend. Busy yourself while I experiment with the ashes within it. Then, return and see what I have made for you.
    2. Asheara: Such a beautiful statuette… But, you’d think it would’ve been better cared for. There’s a compartment here that’s full o’ dust.
    3. Deckard Cain: I’ve read legends about a sage named Ku Y’leh, who studied the mysteries of life beyond death. If I remember correctly, his ashes were ensconced within a golden statuette. It was a very strange tale.
    4. Hratli: You will have to take Ku Y’leh’s ashes to Alkor.
    5. Natalya: I’m having fun just watching you run from place to place searching for a Golden Bird. Some hero you are.

5. 完成任务
    1. Alkor: From the ashes of Ku Y’leh I have mixed for you a potion.
    2. Deckard Cain: So, Meshif had the Golden Bird all along. I wonder if he knows what he gave up for that jade figurine.
    3. Meshif: Immortality is definitely not for me. Can you imagine having to wake up every night just to piss for the next thousand years?
    4. Natalya: I must admit, your foolish quest made little sense to me. But now I see the value of your actions. I believe you do possess great wisdom.
    5. Ormus: Ormus remembers the tale of Ku Y’leh. That venerable sage forgot that there is no life beyond death. There is only life. Once prolonged unnaturally, it can become a living hell.
    6. Ormus (Unused): If Alkor can make you a potion to live after death, use it wisely. Few mortals ever get a second chance at destiny.

### 对话

1. 任务激活

    1. Hratli: As I told you before, I placed an enchantment upon the dockside in order to keep the demons at bay. But lately, the enchantment seems to be weakening. If memory serves me correctly, there is a holy Skatsimi blade that could revitalize the enchantment. The blade is called the Gidbinn. Find it, and our sanctuary here will remain safe.

2. 任务激活后

    1. Alkor: Have you not heard of the Gidbinn? Well, allow me to reduce your ignorance on the subject. The Gidbinn is an enchanted dagger – a religious artifact greatly valued by the Old Religion, Skatsim.
    2. Asheara: The Gidbinn will reinforce the enchantments that protect the dockside from the evil that infests Kurast.
    3. Deckard Cain: I’ve done some research on the Taan mage-clan, and it seems that most of their magical studies were focused on Skatsimi rites. If anyone is qualified to use the powers of the Gidbinn, it would be Ormus.
    4. Hratli: As far as we know, the Gidbinn is in the possession of the Children of Light. They do not wish it to fall into the hands of those who can restore its powers. You may not believe it, but Ormus is the one who can use the Gidbinn to protect us.
    5. Meshif: The Gidbinn is one of the few remaining relics of Skatsim, the Old Religion. It is reputed to have great powers.
    6. Natalya: Don’t let the Gidbinn’s size fool you. Though it is only a small dagger, it holds tremendous power when in the hands of a true Skatsimi mage.
    7. Ormus: Ormus is familiar with the Gidbinn. But how would a powerful Skatsimi artifact aid an unbeliever like you?

3. 中途返回
    1. Alkor: Legend has it that the Skatsimi priests placed great power within the small blade. Power enough to repel this terrible jungle-curse which encroaches on our sanctuary.
    2. Asheara: I’m certain that the Gidbinn is very closely guarded.
    3. Deckard Cain: Since you haven’t come across the Gidbinn yet, the dagger must be deeper in the jungle nearer Kurast.
    4. Hratli: Once the Gidbinn is found, Ormus will use it to strengthen the protective barrier around the dockside.
    5. Meshif: The jungle is like nothing you’ve ever seen before. Imagine Paradise festering like a wound… then bursting!
    6. Natalya: You’d best get back out there and find that blade. The jungle creeps further into this camp by the hour.
    7. Ormus: If we are to have peace from the shadow, you must find the weapon which will destroy the Light.

4. 完成任务
    1. Alkor: Hah! You have stolen the fabled blade from right under Zakarum’s nose! This is a great day, indeed!
    2. Asheara: Now that fewer of the Iron Wolves are needed to guard the dockside, some of them have volunteered to accompany you free of charge.
    3. Deckard Cain: Who could have foreseen that the Old Religion would play such an effective role in our war against the Three? Again, your efforts amaze me, my friend.
    4. Hratli: The Gidbinn’s magic can only be channeled through Ormus. Take it to him. He has the necessary knowledge about the ancient Skatsimi magics.
    5. Meshif: With any luck, the spirits of Skatsim will grant us revenge upon the powers that ravaged this land.
    6. Natalya: You are truly amazing, stranger. There are precious few items in the world that would tempt me to go up against the Children of Zakarum and their midget minions.
    7. Ormus: You have done well, noble hero. Ormus congratulates you. The old spirits of Skatsim will watch over you for returning their sacred blade. Now, after all these years, Ormus will once again use his powers to protect the innocent from the shadow. The spell that protects the dockside shall now be reinforced.

5. 奖励
    1. Ormus: This magic ring does me no good. Here… Wear it proudly! 


## Khalim’s Will

    1. Khalim’s Eye: In a golden chest in the Spider Cavern beneath the Spider Forest.
    2. Khalim’s Brain: in a golden chest on level three of the Flayer Dungeon beneath the Flayer Jungle.
    3. Khalim’s Heart: in a golden chest on level two of the sewers, beneath Lower Kurast or Kurast.

5. Reward: Use Khalim’s Will to smash the Compelling Orb and gain entrance to the Durance of Hate.
6. Quest Priority: Not mandatory if you can get a portal from another player inside the Durance of Hate. Otherwise you must do it to smash the Compelling Orb and get into the Durance.





### 对话

1. 任务激活

    1. Deckard Cain: Never forget that your ultimate purpose here in Kurast is to destroy Mephisto. The ancient Horadrim imprisoned the Lord of Hatred inside the Guardian Tower that is located within the Temple City of Travincal. Know this, friend. The only way to gain entry to Mephisto’s prison is to destroy the artifact known as the Compelling Orb. Mephisto used this device to control the Zakarum Priests and their followers. The Orb can only be destroyed with an ancient flail imbued with the spirit of the one incorruptible priest. Soon after his imprisonment, Mephisto worked his evil corruption on the Zakarum priesthood. All were turned to his dark ways, save one – Khalim, the Que-Hegan of the High Council. Mephisto directed the other Council priests to slay and dismember Khalim and then scatter his remains across the Kingdom. The Priest Sankekur succeeded Khalim as Que-Hegan, eventually becoming the embodiment of Mephisto here on the mortal plane. The corrupted High Council fashioned an Orb to control the rest of the Zakarum faithful and used their powers to hide the lair of their master from mortals. Your task is to collect the scattered relics of Khalim – his Heart, his Brain, and his Eye. Then, using the Horadric Cube, transmute Khalim’s Flail with his relics. Once this is accomplished, you must destroy the Compelling Orb with Khalim’s Will to open the way into the corrupt sanctum of Mephisto.

2. 携带眼睛返回
    1. Deckard Cain: Ahh… Khalim’s Eye! Only it can reveal the true path to Mephisto. Place the Eye in the Horadric Cube along with Khalim’s other relics – the Heart, the Brain, and the Flail.

3. 携带大脑返回
    1. Deckard Cain: This is most fortunate! Khalim’s Brain knows Mephisto’s weakness. Place it in the Horadric Cube along with Khalim’s other relics – the Eye, the Heart, and the Flail.

4. 携带心脏返回
    1. Deckard Cain: You have found Khalim’s Heart, and it still bears the courage to face Mephisto! Place it in the Horadric Cube along with Khalim’s other relics – the Eye, the Brain, and the Flail.

5. 携带连枷返回
    1. Deckard Cain: Once properly imbued, Khalim’s Flail can destroy the Compelling Orb and reveal the way to Mephisto. Place it into the Horadric Cube along with Khalim’s relics – his Heart, his Brain, and his Eye. Then, transmute them to carry out Khalim’s Will.

6. 完成任务
    1. Deckard Cain: Masterfully done, hero! You have crafted Khalim’s Will. Employ it to destroy the Compelling Orb and open the way to Mephisto. May the true Light guide your way. 


## Lam Esen’s Tome

### 详情


1. Quest Name: Lam Esen’s Tome
1. Triggered by: Completing Quest Two, or entering the Ruined Temple
1. Given by: Alkor
1. Location: Ruined Temple in the Kurast Bazaar
1. Rewards: Five stat points
1. Quest Priority: Not required, but most do it to get the bonus stat points.


### 对话

1. 任务激活

    1. Alkor: It pains me to waste time with you, so I’ll get right to the point. There is a very special book which you must find for me. It was written long ago by a sage known as Lam Esen, who studied Skatsimi magic and the effects of the Prime Evils on the mortal world. The Black Book was lost when the Children of Zakarum took over this land. Now, you must reclaim it without delay! Its knowledge may aid us in this dark time ahead.

2. 任务激活后

    1. Alkor: The Black Book contains powerful secrets of Skatsim, the Old Religion, long eclipsed by Zakarum. I should warn you. The Black Book is much sought after by both good and evil. Be wary.
    2. Asheara: Many things can be found in the city of Kurast. The book may be there.
    3. Deckard Cain: The Black Book is a powerful source of information. The Zakarum will do everything in their power to stop you from obtaining it.
    4. Hratli: We have long sought the Black Book of Lam Esen. Rumors of its whereabouts spread as fast as jungle plagues. If you find it, take it to Alkor.
    5. Meshif: Oh. No one really believes that the Black Book exists. It’s just a symbol of Zakarum’s anti-Skatsim propaganda.
    6. Natalya: I’ve heard of the Black Book. My Order’s code is based on many of its passages. If you find it, I will be greatly impressed.
    7. Ormus: The Children of Zakarum believe that the Black Book is filled with blasphemous heresy. In truth, the book may contain the secrets to our ultimate redemption.

3. 中途返回
    1. Alkor: Did I neglect to mention that the book contains useful information about the Prime Evils?
    2. Asheara: I believe I can trust you now. When you first arrived, I suspected you a spy for the Zakarum, the false religion whose faithful are now under the sway of a mysterious power. They’ve made a mockery of the Old Religion of Skatsim.
    3. Deckard Cain: I heard that there are ruined temples in Kurast. Perhaps you will find the Black Book in one of them.
    4. Hratli: Not getting much help? You know, people are like rugs. Hang them out a window and shake ’em a couple times. You’ll be surprised how much dirt comes out.
    5. Meshif: Kurast was once the greatest city in the world. Now it is hard to tell where the jungle stops and the city begins. The jungle grows rampant on the soil enriched by the blood of my fellow citizens.
    6. Natalya: I hope you find the Black Book soon. I could use something to read while I wait for my orders.
    7. Ormus: Even if you find the sacred Book, you must still traverse the jungle of meaning within it. That journey could prove to be far more perilous.

4. 完成任务
    1. Alkor: You have found the Book! It should give all of us here some insight into the nature of the Prime Evils… Ah, but as for you…
    2. Asheara: The Iron Wolves are very impressed by your skills.
    3. Deckard Cain: You have found a source of information powerful enough to turn the tide against the Zakarum.
    4. Hratli: We have the Book. Now we must see if we can bear its revelations.
    5. Meshif: Thank all that’s holy. You’ve returned with the Black Book! Maybe now you can put an end to the Evil that has destroyed my homeland.
    6. Natalya: So, you’ve returned with the Book. You surprise me. You must be very resourceful.
    7. Ormus: Why is the Black Book of Lam Esen like a coffin? Simple. Each holds the shape of our future. 


## The Blackened Temple


### 详情

1. Quest Name: The Blackened Temple
2. Triggered by: Completing Quest Four or entering the Kurast Causeway
3. Given by: Ormus
4. Location: Travincal
5. Rewards: No reward, other than being able to enter the Durance of Hate.
6. Quest Priority: Not required if you can get into the Durance of Hate, but if you can not, then this quest must be completed.


### 对话

1. 任务激活

    1. Ormus: You have done well, my friend. Your courage and valor are an inspiration to us all. But now the time has come to face those responsible for the evil that has stifled our land. You must destroy the High Council of Zakarum! Long ago, these elders were charged with the stewardship of Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred, who was imprisoned within the Guardian Tower. Through the generations, these pious men slowly fell more and more under the sway of Mephisto’s malevolent power and the Council became an evil mockery of its former glory. It is Mephisto’s Hatred that has corrupted Zakarum and turned its devout followers into paranoid fanatics. That is why you must travel to the Temple City of Travincal and slay the Council. Once they are gone, Mephisto’s hold over this land and its people will be broken!

2. 任务激活后

    1. Alkor: The Black Book contains some vague prophecies regarding this undertaking. I’m not so sure it will turn out well for you.
    2. Asheara: The Children of Zakarum who guard the Tower square can be killed, but their numbers are vast. You must destroy their Council.
    3. Deckard Cain: Ormus tells me that the Council is comprised of tremendously powerful priests. It will be difficult to best them.
    4. Hratli: Remember. You can always find sanctuary here with us.
    5. Meshif: There is only one way to the Temple City. You will have to cross many rivers and streams, but you’ll find it. A great tower stands at its center.
    6. Natalya: You are incredibly brave to venture into the lion’s den. I wish you luck.
    7. Ormus: You must know that the Guardian Tower in the Temple City was built by the Horadrim for one purpose – to hold Mephisto. Once the Council is dead, you may enter the Tower.

3. 任务激活后（蓝·伊森的古书任务未完成）

    1. Alkor: I am but a potion dealer and an avid reader of occult books. What do I know of the Travincal?
    2. Asheara: There are many zealots among the followers of Zakarum. It will be difficult to get past them.
    3. Deckard Cain: The Temple City is well guarded. You’d best keep your wits about you.
    4. Hratli: This has been a trying time for all of us, but I sense this nightmare is coming to an end.
    5. Meshif: It has been said that Ormus speaks most clearly when his ideas are utterly mad.
    6. Natalya: Beware the followers of Zakarum. Their fanaticism is their greatest weapon.

4. 中途返回

    1. Alkor: Kill as many as you can. I have a morbid love of excess.
    2. Asheara: The Iron Wolves and I are at the ready to aid you.
    3. Deckard Cain: Sankekur may be using a Compelling Orb to control the minds of the Children of Zakarum.
    4. Hratli: The followers of Zakarum demand complete allegiance to their creed. They have slaughtered many of their own for minor grievances. They will not hesitate to kill you.
    5. Meshif: Within the Temple City is a courtyard. The Council resides there.
    6. Natalya: I respect your need to do this. Honor demands that you see this through. Yet your chances are so slim…
    7. Ormus: If you die on this quest, I will commemorate your sacrifice in an epic poem. You will not need a potion to achieve immortality. Ormus’ words will do that.

5. 中途返回（蓝·伊森的古书任务未完成）

    1. Alkor: If only we could have found the Black Book. I feel as though a malevolent hand has led us away from it.
    2. Asheara: Things are getting wilder than Ladies Night at the Slippery Fist.
    3. Hratli: After having served Mephisto all these years, the Council must be twisted by hatred and evil.
    4. Meshif: I have heard rumors that the Prime Evils are here seeking their Brother.

6. 完成任务

    1. Alkor: You’ve accomplished the impossible! By killing the Council, the curse of Zakarum will be lifted and our land will be free! Oh. Thank you!
    2. Asheara: The sun has set on the Religion of Light.
    3. Deckard Cain: Ridding Kurast of the Council of Zakarum was essential. Still, there is more you must do. The Compelling Orb, too, must be destroyed. Diablo and Baal must be close to finding their brother, Mephisto, by now. You’ve no time to waste.
    4. Hratli: The followers of Zakarum lacked all sense of moderation. The collapse of their tainted religion gives me hope.
    5. Meshif: It seems the jungle is already dying back. You’ve broken the curse, my friend! May the Light bless you!
    6. Natalya: I can hardly believe you did it. Your power blankets you like a shining aura.
    7. Ormus: Ormus is grateful to you, stranger. You have broken the long, dark reign of Zakarum and delivered the first paralyzing blow against the Three. Yet still, the true test lies ahead. For he whom the Council guarded still lives within the Blackened Tower. 


## The Guardian

### 详情

1. Quest Name: The Guardian
2. Triggered by: Smashing the Compelling Orb or entering the Durance of Hate
3. Given by: Ormus
4. Location: Mephisto is on level three of the Durance of Hate, entered from the large temple in Travincal
5. Rewards: None from NPCs, but you will find a portal to take you to Act Four.
6. Quest Priority: You must complete this quest to move on to Act Four

### 对话

1. 任务激活

    1. Ormus: Diablo and Baal have surely found the Temple City by now. They seek to free their Brother, Mephisto, who was imprisoned by the Horadrim in the Temple’s Guardian Tower. You must reach him before his Brothers do and prevent them from releasing Hatred upon the world.

2. 任务激活后

    1. Alkor: The hidden ways of the Tower are long forgotten. Though… it is rumored to have been built as far below the ground as above it.
    2. Asheara: I sent a few of my Iron Wolves on a scouting mission into the jungle near the Temple City… They encountered two cloaked men who attacked them with horrifying powers. My men barely survived. I have to assume that the two strangers are Diablo and Baal. You’d better hurry. They’re close to finding their brother.
    3. Deckard Cain: You must reach Mephisto before his brothers do.
    4. Hratli: Mephisto, along with Baal, was originally captured in the desert near Lut Gholein. But imprisoning two of the Brothers together was far too dangerous. The Horadrim built the Guardian Tower to hold Mephisto. When Zakarum came to power in this land, it took over the Temple City without paying any heed to what was locked within the Tower. And it became their doom.
    5. Meshif: Be careful when you return to the Tower. Though many of the followers of Zakarum have fled, there’s no telling what horrors still lurk inside it.
    6. Natalya: Now you rush to face Mephisto. Don’t give in to your hatred. That is his greatest weapon against you.
    7. Ormus: Make haste! Though the Three are sure to reunite, it is uncertain as to what they have planned once they do. Be cautious, my friend. Though you are mighty, no mortal can stand alone against the power of the Prime Evils.

3. 任务激活后（蓝·伊森的古书任务未完成）

    1. Alkor: We have seen Diablo, but remain unsure of his Brothers’ whereabouts.
    2. Asheara: Many Iron Wolves have disappeared in Travincal. The Evil is still strong there.
    3. Deckard Cain: The ancient Horadrim always feared that the Three would escape their prisons and unite. I can’t believe that I, the last of their Order, have seen it come to pass. You are the only one who can prevent this, my friend. The final hour draws near.
    4. Hratli: I hear there is a little family reunion about to take place in Kurast. The Three brothers draw close.
    5. Meshif: Move quickly, my friend, and end this curse once and for all!

4. 中途返回

    1. Alkor: Well, the good news is that events are unfolding just as Lam Esen foretold. The bad news is that the story ends in our utter ruin!
    2. Asheara: The sudden reduction in our ranks makes us eager to destroy Diablo and his brothers. Vengeance for the Iron Wolves!
    3. Deckard Cain: Search the Tower thoroughly. Mephisto must not escape.
    4. Hratli: Why build a Tower to place the beast below ground? At times I believe the Horadrim lacked common sense.
    5. Meshif: I ought to return to the ship. We may have to sail from here very quickly.
    6. Natalya: Beware, my friend. Sankekur may be the most powerful mortal in the world. He controls thousands of fanatical worshippers and embodies the Lord of Hatred, himself. His death will be no easy task.
    7. Ormus: I understand that the great Patriarch of Zakarum, Sankekur, now embodies Mephisto. You must overcome Hatred lest Terror and Destruction claim us all!

5. 中途返回（蓝·伊森的古书任务未完成）

    1. Alkor: I’m afraid both fear and a large dose of elixir preclude me from answering.
    2. Asheara: We will fight to the death.
    3. Hratli: Shouldn’t you be running frantically up and down stairs about now?
    4. Ormus: I am loath to describe what will happen if Diablo and Baal release Mephisto.

6. 完成任务

    1. Alkor: Your news is great indeed. You have saved us all. I would smile, but I’m afraid my face might collapse.
    2. Asheara: Well done, my friend. You are a great champion of Order. Please, consider yourself an honorary Iron Wolf.
    3. Deckard Cain: Our faith in you was well deserved. But Diablo has made his way to Hell; and it is likely that Baal followed him there. Enter the Infernal Gate and kill the Lord of Terror before all is lost. Only then will our world be saved!
    4. Hratli: It looks like you’re going to Hell before me. Put in a good word.
    5. Meshif: Ahh… Now, Kurast can begin the task of rekindling its former glory… I thank you.
    6. Natalya: Word is spreading fast that you killed Mephisto. I’d be honored to fight beside you in Hell, but I’ve just received my mission orders. I’ll be travelling to the Barbarian lands of the North, but I can’t tell you why. With luck, our paths will cross again. Farewell.
    7. Ormus: You have defeated a Prime Evil in combat. Ormus is impressed beyond words. But staying here will not end this conflict. You must enter the Infernal Gate and stop Diablo once and for all.
