### 对话

1. 任务激活

    1. Tyrael: There is a dark, tortured soul who was trapped within this forsaken realm long ago. He was called Izual by mortal men, and in ages past he was my most trusted Lieutenant. Yet, against my wishes he led an ill-fated assault upon the fiery Hellforge, itself. Despite his valor and strength, Izual was captured by the Prime Evils and twisted by their perverse power. They forced him to betray his own kind and give up Heaven’s most guarded secrets. He became a corrupt shadow of his former self – a fallen angel trusted neither by Heaven nor Hell. For his transgressions, Izual’s spirit was bound within the form of a terrible creature which was summoned from the Abyss. His maddened spirit has resided within that tortured husk for many ages now. It seems to me that he has suffered long enough. I implore you, hero, find Izual and release him from his cruel imprisonment. Put an end to his guilt and suffering.

2. 任务激活后

    1. Deckard Cain: Tyrael has asked you to confront Izual the Fallen? He must have great faith in your abilities! I trust you know what you’re doing… Be careful. You’re our last hope.
    2. Tyrael: Though Izual no longer carries the Angelic Runeblade, Azurewrath, he may still possess great strength and power within his new form. Also, he may not be able to tell friend from foe while in his present state. If you find him, he will almost certainly be hostile. Proceed with the utmost caution.

3. 中途返回

    1. Deckard Cain: Having trouble finding the Fallen Angel, eh? You’d better hurry. It’s beginning to feel like some great evil is permeating the air around here.
    2. Tyrael: You mustn’t delay, mortal hero. Izual must be put to rest, but Diablo still lurks within this realm. Go now… Hurry!

4. 完成任务

    1. Deckard Cain: You’re lucky to be alive, my friend! It is imperative that you find and stop Diablo! You should speak of this with Tyrael. He will know what to make of this.
    2. Izual: Tyrael was a fool to have trusted me! You see, it was I who told Diablo and his Brothers about the Soulstones and how to corrupt them. It was I who helped the Prime Evils mastermind their own exile to your world. The plan we set in motion so long ago cannot be stopped by any mortal agency. Hell, itself, is poised to spill forth into your world like a tidal wave of blood and nightmares. You and all your kind… are doomed.
    3. Tyrael: Thank you, hero, for putting Izual’s tortured spirit to rest. May the Light protect you and the powers of Heaven shine upon your path. But, if what you tell me is true, then I fear that we have been played for fools all along. Izual helped Diablo and his Brothers trick me into using the Soulstones against them… Now the Stones’ powers are corrupted. With the combined powers of the Soulstones under their control, the Prime Evils will be able to turn the mortal world into a permanent outpost of Hell! 



## Hell’s Forge

### 详情

1. Quest Name: Hell’s Forge
2. Triggered by: Completing Quest One, or entering the River of Flame
3. Given by: Cain
4. Location: Hellforge in the River of Flame
5. Reward: Smashing Mephisto’s Soul Stone on the Hellforge drops four random type gems, one normal, two flawless, one perfect per player finishing the quest. The Expansion adds one dropped Rune per game. The rune is randomly selected from within the following ranges:
    1. Normal: El (r01) – Amn (r11).
    2. Nightmare: Sol (r12) – Um (r22).
    3. Hell: Hel (r15) – Gul (r25).
6. Quest Priority: Optional quest, but a good reward. It was frequently skipped in v1.08 and earlier since Hephasto was so fierce. In D2X it’s much easier and has a better quest reward.

### 对话

    1. Deckard Cain: The time has come for you to destroy Mephisto’s Soulstone! Take the Stone to the Hellforge. Place it upon the forge and strike it soundly with the Hammer. Only by doing this can you prevent Mephisto from manifesting in this world ever again.

2. 任务激活（未拾取墨菲斯托的灵魂之石）

    1. Deckard Cain: The time has come to destroy Mephisto’s Soulstone! Although I picked it up before entering the Infernal Gate, I believe you should carry out this crucial mission. Take the Stone to the Hellforge. Place it upon the forge and strike it soundly with the Hammer. Only by doing this can you prevent Mephisto from manifesting in this world ever again.

3. 任务激活后

    1. Hadriel: Halt! Before venturing into Diablo’s lair, go to the Hellforge with Mephisto’s Soulstone. Place the stone on the Hellforge and use the Hellforge Hammer to destroy it.

4. 完成任务

    1. Deckard Cain: Congratulations, hero! Surely, even Diablo, himself, sensed the fury unleashed when you smashed his Brother’s Soulstone.
    2. Hadriel: Proceed, hero, into Terror’s lair. Know that Diablo’s innermost sanctum is hidden by five seals. Only by opening each of these seals can you clear your way to the final battle.

### 对话

1. 任务激活

    1. Tyrael: The time has come to hunt down and destroy Diablo, himself. But beware, the Lord of Terror is not to be underestimated. He single-handedly destroyed the town of Tristram and corrupted the last noble hero who tried to stop him. This time, you must defeat him for good. Only by destroying the Soulstone which he carries will his spirit be banished forever. Good luck! Though this be our darkest hour, it may yet be your greatest moment.

2. 任务激活后

    1. Deckard Cain: You don’t have time to dally about here! Diablo awaits you in Hell. Remember… Diablo’s greatest weapon against you is Terror. Don’t give in to your fears. Resist his power and put an end to him for good!
    2. Hadriel: Proceed, hero, into Terror’s lair. Know that Diablo’s innermost sanctum is hidden by five seals. Only by opening each of these seals can you clear your way to the final battle.

3. 完成任务（《暗黑破坏神II》）

    1. Deckard Cain: I knew there was great potential in you, my friend. You’ve done a fantastic job. Though my ancestors often struggled against the Three Evils and their minions, I’ve always lived a shut-in, scholarly life. I’m glad that my wisdom aided you. Now, I wish to leave this place. Though Heaven’s Gates are a marvel to behold, I hope I won’t have to see them again for many, many years.
    2. Tyrael: Praise be to the Light! You have accomplished the impossible! Diablo and Mephisto have been banished back into the Black Abyss that spawned them and the corrupted Soulstones are no more. You’ve done well, hero. For now, you should rejoice.

4. 完成任务（《暗黑破坏神II：毁灭之王》）

    1. Deckard Cain: I knew there was great potential in you, my friend. You’ve done a fantastic job. Though my ancestors often struggled against the Three Evils and their minions, I’ve always lived a shut-in, scholarly life. I’m glad that my wisdom aided you. Now, I wish to leave this place. Though Heaven’s Gates are a marvel to behold, I hope I won’t have to see them again for many, many years. Please talk to Tyrael about leaving this place now!
    2. Tyrael: Praise be to the Light! You have accomplished the impossible! Diablo and Mephisto have been banished back into the Black Abyss that spawned them, and the corrupted Soulstones are no more. However, while you were fighting here, Baal remained behind in the mortal realm, building an army of hellish minions. Now, Baal’s army is searching for the Worldstone, the ancient source of all the Soulstones and their power, while leaving behind a wake of destruction. They have forged deeply into the Barbarian homelands, heading directly for the summit of Mount Arreat! Baal knows, mortal hero! That is the very site of the blessed Worldstone! Now, enter the portal I have opened for you. It will take you to the Barbarian city of Harrogath, the last bastion of Order on the slopes of Arreat.
