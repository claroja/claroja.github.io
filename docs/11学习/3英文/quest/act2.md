    1. Atma: I don’t expect this of you, but if you want to help me, I would be grateful. In the sewers below our city, there lurks a horrid creature that hungers for human flesh. The creature has killed many, including my son and my husband. If you destroy it, I will reward you. Please be careful though, that beast has taken enough from us already. The sewer entrance is through the trap door just up the street.

2. 任务激活后

    1. Atma: The creature makes its lair in the tunnels beneath this city. He butchered my husband and son… I simply cannot bear to talk about it…
    2. Deckard Cain: The Horadrim used to mummify their highest mages, and infuse them with spells that would allow them to protect their tombs, even after death. I have no idea why one of them would be acting so malevolently. Perhaps Drognan or Fara would know more about this.
    3. Drognan: Fara and I have been talking about the creature recently. From my studies, I have deduced that it is Radament the Fallen, an ancient Horadric mummy that has for some reason left his tomb to prey on mortals. I’m doing some more research now. If you check back later, I may have some more insight as to his nature.
    4. Elzix: I hear that the creature kills his victims in order to hack off their limbs! I guess that makes me a less likely candidate, eh?
    5. Fara: I believe that the creature you refer to is one of the ancient Horadric mummies from the tombs that lie buried beneath the desert sands. It is unusual for one of his kind to be so far away from his resting place. I sense in this entity a restless and malevolent spirit.
    6. Geglash: Whoah oh… ‘Radament the Fallen’, is it? I’ve fallen off many a barstool and no one calls me ‘Geglash the Fallen’. They might go so far as to say, ‘Geglash, you’ve fallen!’
    7. Greiz: I’ve personally found some of that devil’s victims washed up out of the sewer. Often, they are missing limbs or a head, and their bodies have always been skinned. At first the creature raided the town at night… That’s how Atma lost her family. Now we’ve got him barricaded in the sewers. You’re safe up here on the surface, but every now and again some fool wants to be a hero and heads down to the waste tunnels with a pig-sticker.
    8. Lysander: I hear that beast is after body parts. Does he eat them? Oooh… Ghastly!
    9. Meshif: There are two entrances to the sewers, I believe. One of them is right near here, down by the water beneath the docks. I can see it from my ship, and you can bet I keep an eye on it every night.
    10. Warriv: I’ve heard tales of walking corpses out in the desert at night, though I’ve never actually seen one.

3. 中途返回
    1. Atma: I am starting to have second thoughts about my request… I couldn’t bear the thought of you losing your life on my behalf. Please be careful.
    2. Deckard Cain: The Horadric mummies were created to protect the tombs, but Radament is far from his burial chamber. Given the aberrations that have been witnessed lately, it comes as no surprise that even the ancient guardian spells have begun to unravel. Be wary of this as you venture farther into the desert.
    3. Drognan: I’ve just been reading something interesting about this sort of undead. Apparently, certain Horadric funereal priests altered the bodies of their dead mages with magical and surgical techniques — often replacing body parts with those of animals. This was thought to augment their powers, and raise their status in the afterlife.
    4. Elzix: If you’re going to fight that thing, use some common sense. Be knowledgeable about what harms the undead. Poison, for instance, will have little effect.
    5. Fara: Drognan told me something interesting earlier today. It might explain why Radament is so restless, and it might have something to do with why he is stealing human body parts.
    6. Geglash: Ah-hah! Back for a small shot of courage… Believe me, it doesn’t help for long. Drinks, barkeep!
    7. Greiz: We’ve been meaning to send an organized group down there to kill that thing, but it would be dangerous. We just can’t afford the chance of losing any men with all the trouble that’s going on in the desert.
    8. Lysander: Huh? Peppermint? Oh, Radament! Yes, yes. Ooh, a foul creature… Some of my exploding potions should do quite nicely against him. They usually work well against the undead.
    9. Meshif: I noticed a rotting, human arm floating in the harbor this morning. I suspected foul play, so I told Greiz. He didn’t seem too concerned since there haven’t been any folk reported missing lately.
    10. Warriv: Death is not afraid of the living, but the living abhor death.

4. 完成任务
    1. Atma: They say that the taste of vengeance is bittersweet, but I find it to my liking. In addition to my undying gratitude, I have spoken on your behalf with the rest of the townspeople. The merchants have agreed to show their gratitude by offering their wares and services at lower rates. Oh… Jerhyn wants to see you, too. You’ll find him in front of the palace.
    2. Deckard Cain: If you haven’t already, tell Atma that Radament is dead. It may help to ease the weight of her mourning.
    3. Drognan: From what you tell me, it would seem that Radament was bent on the task of reviving his own mummified corpse with the flesh of the living. This is very unusual indeed. It takes an incredible magic power to alter the singular purpose of an undead mind. Perhaps there is a power at work here which is beyond my ken.
    4. Elzix: We ran into one of those old tomb guardians when I ran with my bandits. I know they aren’t easy foes to face, so you sure have my respect. Have you told Atma yet?
    5. Fara: As you have helped Atma and all of us, so shall I help you.
    6. Geglash: Whoah oh… ‘Radament the Fallen’, is it? I’ve fallen off many a barstool and no one calls me ‘Geglash the Fallen’. They might go so far as to say, ‘Geglash, you’ve fallen!’
    7. Greiz: You’ve killed Radament, eh? That’s quite a nice piece of work! If you ever need a job as a mercenary, I’d be happy to sign ya’ up.
    8. Lysander: Uh… Little of what I am able to hear is of any value. Radament’s death, however, is news worth hearing. I’m sure Atma will be glad to hear of this.
    9. Meshif: Good job mate! At night out on my ship, I was often awakened by that fiend’s awful moaning. I bet I rest easier now.
    10. Warriv: Atma’s been telling everyone what you’ve done for her. 


## The Horadric Staff

### 详情

1. Quest Name: The Horadric Staff
2. Triggered By: Returning the Horadric Scroll to Deckard Cain or recovering the Horadric Cube
3. Given by: Cain
4. Location: Horadric Cube: Halls of the Dead, Staff of Kings: Sand Maggot Hive level three, * Viper Amulet: Claw Viper Temple, level two
5. Reward: The Horadric Cube is kept after the quest, and used throughout the game for many useful purposes. More info about it here.
6. Quest Priority: It is mandatory if you are playing alone, but not mandatory if you party with someone else who has the Horadric Staff.


### 对话

1. 任务激活

    1. Deckard Cain: Ahh… The lost Horadric Scroll! What a fortunate turn of events… As the last living Horadrim, I alone have knowledge of its meaning. Now, to read the Horadric runes it bears. Hmmm… The Horadric Mages, after binding Baal within Tal Rasha, magically sealed off his Burial Chamber from the mortal realm. Those same Mages also crafted fearsome Horadric Staves and imbued them with the special power to open the Chamber’s hidden door. After nearly losing one to the thievery of a rogue sorcerer, they divided all the Horadric Staves into two parts – wooden shaft and metal headpiece – hiding them separately to safeguard them. The Horadrim foresaw our current plight and designed the hiding places to reveal themselves to worthy heroes like you. Collect both parts of a Horadric Staff and unite them using a Horadric Cube. Then, you may enter Tal Rasha’s Burial Chamber.

2. 携带赫拉迪克方块返回
    1. Deckard Cain: You have quite a treasure there in that Horadric Cube. According to Horadric lore, the Cube can restore a Horadric Staff. To do it – use the Cube as you would a scroll. When the Cube opens, place both pieces of the Staff into it and use the Cube’s transmute power. You’ll be pleased to know that the Cube has other alchemical uses as well… Six gems plus one sword transmute into a socketed long sword. You may also transmute two quivers of crossbow bolts into one quiver of arrows, while two quivers of arrows yield one quiver of bolts. I must leave it to you to discover other formulae.

3. 携带国王之杖返回
    1. Deckard Cain: The Staff of Kings! You astound me, my friend. You have discovered the shaft portion of a Horadric Staff. I trust you know how to use a Horadric Cube to unite the shaft with its headpiece.

4. 携带蝮蛇护身符返回
    1. Deckard Cain: The Viper Amulet you bear is actually the headpiece of a Horadric Staff! Yes… You have an uncanny knack for finding rare and valuable artifacts. Of course, you’ll have to use a Horadric Cube to combine the headpiece with the shaft.

5. 携带赫拉迪克法杖返回
    1. Deckard Cain: Excellent! You have a Horadric Staff. Carry it with you into Tal Rasha’s Tomb. Find within the Tomb the chamber whose floor is inset with the Circle of Seven Symbols. Place the Staff into the receptacle you find there. That will open the secret passage into Tal Rasha’s Burial Chamber. But, be prepared for a fight – you’ll likely have to kill Tal Rasha to destroy Baal. 


## Tainted Sun

### 详情

1. Quest Name: The Tainted Sun
2. Triggered By: Entering the Lost City
3. Given by: Drognan
4. Location: The Serpent Altar is found on level two of the Claw Viper Temple
5. Reward: None, other than the Viper Amulet and returning sunlight to the surface areas of the Act.
6. Quest Priority: Mandatory if you are playing alone, since you must have the Horadric Staff to access Tal Rasha’s Tomb. If you are in a party with someone who has the Staff, you don’t need to do it.


### 对话

1. 任务激活后

    1. Atma: Drognan, the wizard, will have some idea as to what is happening.
    2. Deckard Cain: Drognan may have some advice on this matter. Hmm… I think I’ll speak with him myself.
    3. Drognan: I’ve been researching this lengthy eclipse and I believe it to be the work of Claw Vipers. Find their temple beneath the desert sands and you may find the source of this curse.
    4. Elzix: Two men arrived late last night bearing a story about evil magic. They said they saw a gathering of giant snake creatures performing some arcane ritual. They sound like the Serpent Men of the desert.
    5. Fara: This unnatural nightfall is no doubt caused by evil sorcery. Drognan might know what we are dealing with.
    6. Geglash: This whole place is one big ale fog.
    7. Greiz: This midday darkness reeks of foul magic! My men and I are trying to keep the peace, but this kind of thing really scares people.
    8. Jerhyn: My astrologers failed to predict this eclipse. You should seek Drognan’s advice.
    9. Lysander: Claw Vipers! This outer darkness mirrors the inner blackness of their souls. It is they who have eclipsed the sun, I’ll wager. They are a venomous band.
    10. Meshif: This permanent darkness is very unsettling. Hmmm… It would make navigation by stars easier for me, though.
    11. Warriv: The sun has grown disgusted with the terrible deeds it must shine upon each day. Damnation is upon us all.

2. 中途返回
    1. Atma: I was going to go to bed, but then I realized that I have no idea what time it is. It could be the crack of dawn, for all I know.
    2. Deckard Cain: The source of this spell is probably a magical altar. It will not be enough to kill the Claw Vipers. To reverse the spell you must destroy the altar.
    3. Drognan: I’ve discovered a reference to a similar eclipse several hundred years ago. It says that some desert-dwelling snake demons had erected an evil altar, which caused the sun to go black. Perhaps we are dealing with something similar here. Look for an altar in the Claw Viper temple.
    4. Elzix: I usually charge for rooms by the night. But I may have to soon change that.
    5. Fara: The Claw Vipers practice evil magic. They have also been known to kidnap travelers and sacrifice them to their dark gods.
    6. Geglash: It’s strange when the morning after the night before… is still the same night.
    7. Greiz: Don’t worry! My men and I have an iron grip on this town. If those cursed Claw Vipers are plotting anything against us, we’ll be prepared for ’em.
    8. Jerhyn: This eclipse is a definite manifestation of evil.
    9. Lysander: Well… I don’t know much about the habits of Claw Vipers, to be honest. Drognan will probably know something about the nature of the magic at work.
    10. Meshif: I’ve had about enough of this darkness. I don’t even know what day it is anymore.
    11. Warriv: The calculated coldness of the reptilian brain makes the Claw Vipers uncanny adversaries.

3. 完成任务
    1. Atma: You have done well to restore light to our world.
    2. Deckard Cain: I’ve been speaking with Lord Jerhyn, and I sense that he is becoming more and more agitated by something. You should try to talk to him again. If he still won’t take you into his confidence, seek to prove yourself a bit more. I gather that his respect for you is growing.
    3. Drognan: You did well in destroying the Claw Vipers. We are all glad to see the sun returned to its former glory.
    4. Elzix: Ahh… It takes but one eye to revel in the beauty of our restored sun.
    5. Fara: Drognan seems to have taken you into his confidence. This is good, for you will benefit from his wisdom.
    6. Geglash: So, this is daylight… It’s over-rated.
    7. Greiz: I’m glad that’s over with!
    8. Jerhyn: The sun again shines on Lut Gholein! I’m beginning to like you, traveler.
    9. Lysander: Ahhh… Claw Vipers are fond of magical artifacts. Did you happen to find one in their temple?
    10. Meshif: So… Did you plunder any booty?
    11. Warriv: With renewed daylight, one may gather the wits that were scattered about like restrictive undergarments in the darkness. 




## Arcane Sanctuary

### 详情


1. Quest Name: Arcane Sanctuary
2. Triggered By: Showing Cain the Horadric Staff
3. Given by: Lord Jerhyn
4. Location: Find the portal to the Arcane Sanctuary on the third level of the Harem Cellar
5. Reward: None, other than access to the Arcane Sanctuary, which you need to complete Quest Five.
6. Quest Priority: Mandatory if you are solo. In a party you do not need to, if someone else in the party has the Horadric Staff or has already finished off the Summoner (Quest Five) and you can get a portal to the Tombs or the Canyon of the Magi.

### 对话

1. 任务激活

    1. Drognan: I’ve been researching the old records, trying to find the location of Tal Rasha’s Tomb. Though I haven’t found the Tomb, itself, I may have a good lead for you. The great Vizjerei Summoner, Horazon, built his Arcane Sanctuary somewhere around here. He was a powerful spellcaster and kept demons as slaves within the Sanctuary. He kept a close eye on great events, too — such as the imprisonment of Baal within Tal Rasha’s Tomb. If you could find Horazon’s Sanctuary, I’m sure that it would hold some clue as to the Tomb’s location. Though I doubt Horazon is still alive, you must proceed with caution. There’s no telling what could be waiting inside. When I spoke of this with Lord Jerhyn, he asked that I send you to him. Perhaps he knows of a secret entrance or the like.

2. 任务激活后

    1. Atma: Arcane Sanctuary? That place sounds awful! Even if you find a way into it, what makes you think you’ll be able to leave again?
    2. Deckard Cain: I very much doubt that Horazon still lives in his Sanctuary. He possessed great power and influence over demons, but even that may not have been enough in the end. One of his notoriety cannot easily remove himself from the vengeful reach of Hell.
    3. Drognan: Nearly a thousand years ago, Horazon rose to the fore of the Vizjerei mage clan. Horazon used the knowledge of the Vizjerei to summon and control demons from Hell. Though a powerful Summoner, Horazon feared that the Lords of Hell would punish him for enslaving their brethren. Thus, the Summoner created for himself an Arcane Sanctuary. He believed that his Sanctuary would not only protect him from Hell’s vengeance, but also allow him to continue his studies free from the ravages of time and disease. Horazon had crafted many wondrous scrying devices through which he observed the events of the world outside. It is certain that he took careful study of Tal Rasha’s imprisonment and recorded the location of his forgotten Tomb. The Arcane Sanctuary was believed to have been constructed here in Lut Gholein. An entrance may be hidden somewhere in the palace, as that building is very old, and was once a Vizjerei fortress.
    4. Elzix: An ‘Arcane Sanctuary’ under the palace? I’d heard that there were some underground cellar levels that Jerhyn used as chambers for his treasure and such, but no Arcane Sanctuary.
    5. Fara: Ah, the ancient mage Horazon! He believed that he could bend Evil forces to his will. What he didn’t know was that Evil uses man, not the reverse. The Vizjerei still revere him as a symbol of man’s ability to triumph over other worldly forces. The Church of Light, however, cites him as an example of man’s folly.
    6. Geglash: Look, look… I’m just about as tough and arrogant as they come, but you’d never catch me trying to tame a demon for a pet. That’s just asking for a lot of trouble.
    7. Greiz: The only thing in Jerhyn’s cellar are the harem girls that have been hiding there since the troubles began.
    8. Jerhyn: When the troubles began here, I allowed the terrified Harem guilds to join me within the safety of the palace. All was fine, until one night… Screams echoed up the stairwells from the harem. My guards arrived to find the poor girls being slaughtered by a merciless band of hell-spawned demons. My brave guardsmen tried to push the demons back into the mysterious rift from which they came. Ever since, my men have fought a losing battle. Demons have continued to pour through the rift into the palace. Ultimately, I hired Greiz and his mercenaries to help protect the rest of my fair city. Drognan believes that the Arcane Sanctuary lies buried underneath this palace, since Lut Gholein occupies the site of an ancient Vizjerei fortress. My palace is open to you now… Take care.
    9. Lysander: Horazon found it necessary to lock himself up for all time, just to protect himself from those angry demons. Such is the fate of one who practices the summoning arts… that, or eternal damnation. There’s old summoners and bold summoners, but no old, bold summoners.
    10. Meshif: Ahh… The legend of Horazon is an old one, especially around these parts. You wouldn’t believe the feats and strange events that are attributed to him.
    11. Warriv: A careful caravan gives wide berth to sleeping bandits. If Horazon is gone, let him remain so.

3. 中途返回
    1. Atma: So you’ve been in the palace, have you? Tell me, why does Jerhyn keep that place locked up so tight?
    2. Deckard Cain: I’ve been thinking about the problems in Jerhyn’s palace. Perhaps this has occurred to you as well… If those cellar passageways lead to the Arcane Sanctuary, then that is where the demons came from. Horazon’s haven must have been breached!
    3. Drognan: I am certain that you will find the information you need when you find Horazon’s Journal. I suggest you find it quickly, for Diablo may be getting closer to freeing his brother as we speak.
    4. Elzix: I understand that you’ve been talking to Jerhyn. Well, if so, then you’re the first in a long while… since the trouble began, actually. Do us a favor and try to find out what’s got Jerhyn so edgy all the time. OK?
    5. Fara: Even a sanctuary such as Horazon’s can be breached by the tentacles of Evil. Such a haven could have become a chamber of unspeakable horrors. Be wary of what you may unleash!
    6. Geglash: All my years of brawling, of pummeling both the unsuspecting and the deserving, have yielded two insights. You can either fight or you can run. All other strategies are variations of these.
    7. Greiz: What’s got you so occupied in the palace? Don’t tell me you’re finding the Harems more compelling than killing demons? That would be out of character for one such as yourself.
    8. Jerhyn: There was an eastern mage… a Vizjerei, I believe… who visited me almost a year ago. He was very interested in the history of this site, and he seemed particularly fascinated with the palace architecture. I gave him a tour. When he found the ancient seals over a passageway in the cellar, he became very agitated. He asked for some time alone to study them, and I granted it. Shortly after, he left with no further word and I never saw him again. Odd… Don’t you think?
    9. Lysander: Huh? The horizon is always out of reach, you should know that. Oh, Horazon! Oh, I see. Uh. Yes. Well. He was insane. Brilliant, yes, but… total lunatic.
    10. Meshif: So… Now that you’re such a pal of Jerhyn, why don’t you ask him if I can set sail one of these days? I’m running out of patience.
    11. Warriv: Fate is like a caged gorilla. It will pelt you with dung if you mock it.
    12. Others: Horazon’s Journal: Seekers of the Tomb of Tal Rasha will find it through the Portal. But know that the glowing glyphs recorded here in my Arcane Sanctuary are the signs of the six False Tombs. The missing Seventh Sign marks the Tomb of Tal Rasha… Of the Horadrim he might be called the foremost. It was a shining – but brief – moment for the Mage Clans when they set aside their differences and worked together against the common enemy. The Horadrim relentlessly pursued the Three across the desolate Empires of the East, and even into the uncharted lands of the West, leaving the Archangel Tyrael’s hands unblemished. Presuming the Three to be vanquished, the Horadrim’s unstable fellowship began to dissipate. Abandoning their sacred charge to safeguard the three Soulstones, the disparate Mage Clans began to squabble amongst each other over petty differences. Their conflicts not only dissolved their brotherhood, but strengthened the Evils which they had buried beneath the cold earth.

4. 完成任务
    1. Atma: Oh, those poor women! Will the slaughter never end? Thank you once again for protecting our city.
    2. Deckard Cain: You must move quickly now, friend, for Diablo is undoubtedly close to finding what he seeks. Find the Tomb of Tal Rasha before he frees the Lord of Destruction.
    3. Drognan: You have found Horazon’s Journal. Excellent… But, I must caution you. The mark of the True Tomb of Tal Rasha, is sought, if not already known, by Diablo. I needn’t elaborate on the implications of that.
    4. Elzix: News of the tragedy in the palace is spreading fast. How awful! And to think, this whole time I thought Jerhyn and his guards were in there playing with the harem girls.
    5. Fara: Faith is stronger than any armor. The shield will protect the body, but Faith will strengthen the courageous heart.
    6. Geglash: Hah! I wish Jerhyn would’ve let me in the palace. I would’ve saved those girls and kicked demon ass back to the fire-pits o’ Hell!
    7. Greiz: Unbelievable! The Harem girls are dead! The palace guards have been fighting off demons from the cellar. How could that happen without my knowledge?
    8. Jerhyn: I thank you for your heroic aid! I’m also glad that you found something you were looking for. The journal should help you find the True Tomb of Tal Rasha. Hopefully, there is still time to get there before Diablo. Go now. And good luck.
    9. Lysander: Horazon’s urinal? Oh, journal! Yes, well… Glad you found it. Such a shame about those poor harem girls, huh? I shall miss them deeply… I mean their conversations, of course.
    10. Meshif: So… Now we know Jerhyn’s little secret. Well… I guess I can see why he wanted me to stay, though… I’m just glad it didn’t come to that. Now he tells me to wait some more, in case you need to get out of here. Well, for you I’ll do it. Maybe they’ll mention me in the epic ballads, eh?
    11. Warriv: Well, the news going around town is very unsettling. Apparently, we were in more danger than anyone thought. Good work friend… you may have saved all our skins. 


## The Summoner

### 详情

1. Quest Name: The Summoner
2. Triggered By: Talking to Cain once you reach the Arcane Sanctuary, or just moving near the Summoner’s location in the Arcane Sanctuary
3. Given by: Deckard Cain
4. Location: The Summoner is found at the tip of one of the four points of the Arcane Sanctuary
5. Reward: Killing The Summoner opens a portal to the Canyon of the Magi, and reveals the true tomb of Tal Rasha.
6. Quest Priority: This quest is not mandatory. You can party with someone who has done it and has the Horadric Staff, or if you have the Horadric Staff you can just explore the seven tombs at random until you find the correct one if you can get to the Canyon of the Magi.


### 对话

1. 中途返回

    1. Atma: You always seem to find the worst trouble. I don’t know how you handle it.
    2. Deckard Cain: The appearance of the mage you describe sounds like one I met back in Tristram. Many Vizjerei came to fight against Diablo, the Lord of Terror. Perhaps, this is one of them. You know, fate seems to have frowned upon all of the heroes who confronted that terrible Evil. Take care or the same may happen to you.
    3. Drognan: Yes… The man you speak of sounds like the mage who came here many months ago. He claimed to have fought Diablo in the passages beneath Tristram. No doubt the fool wandered into Horazon’s Sanctuary and lost whatever was left of his ravaged mind. He is beyond salvation. It is possible that the fool has been possessed by the spirit of Horazon. If that’s true, then you’d better put an end to his tortured existence. Once done, I believe the demons who were summoned and imprisoned within the Sanctuary will cease to exist as well.
    4. Elzix: Ugh… Crazy mages give me the creeps. Just kill him and get on with your business.
    5. Fara: Hmmm… That doesn’t sound like Horazon. I’ll agree that he may have gone mad, but from what you tell me, I don’t think that’s the case. Talk to Drognan… he may know more than I.
    6. Geglash: So! Horazon’s crazy, eh? I’d be surprised if he wasn’t. All those centuries without ale would drive anyone to drink… but then you couldn’t drink. And that would drive you to drink… Hah?… What was the question?
    7. Greiz: That guy really talks like that? Sounds like either Horazon has gone stir-crazy or that’s some impostor.
    8. Jerhyn: The man you describe is probably not Horazon. He sounds like the very mage who came around here a while ago. He was very curious about this palace and seemed especially interested in the seal on the passageway in the cellar. He left shortly after that. I wonder how he got down there? The seal was never broken… That mage spoke a great deal to Drognan. Why don’t you ask him about it?
    9. Lysander: Ah, yes. I remember. There was a… fellow around here many months ago who asked almost as many questions about Horazon as you. So… He discovered enough to assume Horazon’s place in the Arcane Sanctuary, huh? What a fool!
    10. Meshif: Ah, yes. As a ship captain I am well aware of the phenomenon of a false Horazon. Sorry, just a little joke.
    11. Warriv: There’s nothing more dreadful than a powerful being driven by a frayed mind.

2. 完成任务

    1. Atma: You’re more the hero than I could have dreamed. Perhaps, there is hope for us after all.
    2. Deckard Cain: I hope that this false Summoner found peace in death. Unfortunately, it is more likely that he will be dragged down into Hell by the demons he was bound to. Let this be a lesson to you… Demonic magic is a quick path, but its powers are seductive and deadly.
    3. Drognan: Larger forces are moving inexorably towards us. You must now make haste to the Tombs.
    4. Elzix: You make me long for the days of glory. When I had both hands, both eyes and more of a foot…
    5. Fara: I feel no pity for that would-be Summoner. His terrible ambition for demonic power was his undoing. You merely hastened the inevitable.
    6. Geglash: The way I see it… Well, it’s all pretty blurry.
    7. Greiz: So, Horazon’s been dead for some time. I take it you at least found what you were looking for.
    8. Jerhyn: The demonic force that was emanating from the corrupted Sanctuary has dissipated. I thank you greatly for your help. Now, we can look to rebuilding our lives. All will be for nothing, though, if you do not stop the greater Evil which is rapidly gaining ground.
    9. Lysander: Huhhh… Such is always the fate of those who meddle with evil.
    10. Meshif: Well! You’ve got what you’re after. Now get a move on before it’s too late.
    11. Warriv: I guess you’ll be heading to the Tombs now? I hear that they’re in the deepest desert regions.

### 对话

1. 任务激活

    1. Jerhyn: I have heard of your many deeds of skill and bravery. I feel I can trust you with something I have been hesitant to speak of… Drognan and I have concluded that the Dark Wanderer who passed through here recently was Diablo, himself! Drognan believes that Diablo is searching the desert for the secret tomb where the great Horadric mage, Tal Rasha, keeps Baal imprisoned. You must find Diablo and put an end to the terrible evil that has fallen upon our city. Drognan is wise and is sure to have some helpful advice for you as to how Tal Rasha’s tomb may be found. It may take you quite some time to find The Tomb. May you be ready when you do.

2. 任务激活后

    1. Atma: I’ve heard legends of the Tomb of Tal Rasha, but I thought they were just old tales meant to scare young children.
    2. Deckard Cain: Diablo nears his goal. We have little time to lose. Remember, my friend, that Andariel gave herself willingly to Diablo’s cause. It would be prudent to assume that the other Evils will attempt to aid their master as well.
    3. Drognan: Tal Rasha’s tomb is hidden deep in the desert among six others. Tal Rasha’s symbol marks the True Tomb. If you want to know what that symbol is, you should be able to find it within the legendary Arcane Sanctuary.
    4. Elzix: So… You’re going to search for the Seven Tombs, huh? Don’t you know that they’re just desert legends passed between merchants and travelers? No one really believes that they exist.
    5. Fara: Legend has it that Tal Rasha lies imprisoned within his tomb, forever struggling to keep the Lord of Destruction bound. His was a selfless act, although perhaps foolhardy.
    6. Geglash: Ohh… I’d go with ya’ to those tombs… But… umm… I don’t like all that living dead stuff.
    7. Greiz: If you’re going into the deep desert, why not hire a few of my men to watch your back?
    8. Jerhyn: It is well-known that there are seven great Horadric tombs hidden beneath the sands in the furthest reaches of the desert. One of them surely must be Tal Rasha’s prison. You must explore each of the tombs to find Tal Rasha’s exact location. Of course, Diablo is searching for the Tomb as well… No one can guess as to what terrors he has unleashed in his search.
    9. Lysander: When Tal Rasha chose to embody the spirit of Baal, he knew his doom was to wrestle eternally against the will of the greater Evil. Look around you and ask yourself, ‘Has the battle been won or lost?
    10. Meshif: I’m sorry, I can’t help you much here. Now, if the tombs were across the ocean, then I’d be the guy to talk to.
    11. Warriv: Be very careful, my friend. I think I’ve seen enough recently not to doubt that these Tombs exist. And if they do, they’re most certainly guarded by terrible creatures.

3. 完成任务

    1. Atma: You have proven to be the greatest of heroes, and I am honored to call you friend. Thank you for bringing peace to our lives again.
    2. Deckard Cain: The Archangel Tyrael was the one who gave the Soulstones to the Horadrim two hundred and sixty years ago. It is highly unusual for the forces of Heaven to so directly interfere with man’s destiny, but Tyrael was said to act of his own volition. We have never been able to discern why. Perhaps, he goes against the consensus of Heaven because he doubts our ability to defend ourselves, or perhaps, he sees more threat than his peers. Where the actions of Hell often seem straightforwardly bent on destruction, the motives of Heaven are unfathomable. Now make haste… Both Diablo and Baal must be stopped before they join with their brother, Mephisto. If the three Prime Evils unite once again, the world as we know it will be no more.
    3. Drognan: This is a serious setback… It is most unfortunate that Tal Rasha has been consumed by Baal’s destructive influence. There are many secrets known to the Horadrim, which could be used by Baal against us. You must travel east by sea to Kurast and stop Diablo and Baal before they free their eldest brother, Mephisto. Hahh… The lands of the eastern Empire are not the same as they used to be. There has been little word for some time. Speed is of the essence. Go quickly, my friend. May the fates smile on you.
    4. Elzix: I heard that Diablo has managed to best you, at least for the time being. I hope you catch up with him soon, and send him back to Hell for good!
    5. Fara: This is terrible news! Baal is in possession of one of mankind’s most powerful mages, and the Lord of Terror guides his path. They must be stopped, for I am sure they mean to free their elder brother Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred, who lies imprisoned under the corrupted city of Kurast. I fear you are walking into a great evil, but your faith can save you. May you walk in the light always.
    6. Geglash: You’re an inspiration! And such a hero that it makes me look twice as bad… Ahh, you’re OK… Hey! Just save some glory for us little guys, huh?
    7. Greiz: I’ve heard that your foe got away from you this time. Well, look at it this way… you’ve got the demons on the run. If you’re going to be leaving, then… Well, thanks for your help.
    8. Jerhyn: You have done very well. Few could have come this far, let alone discover the True Tomb of Tal Rasha. Unfortunately, I hear that Diablo and Baal have eluded your grasp. This is most unfortunate… If you wish to travel East, I have authorized Meshif to give you passage by sea. I imagine he should be very anxious to leave by now. Good luck on your quest, and thank you again for saving my beloved city. You will always be welcome in Lut Gholein, my friend.
    9. Lysander: I’m sorry things didn’t turn out as you had hoped. Go and remember us fondly. You know, you bothered me far less than most.
    10. Meshif: Jerhyn tells me I should take you east to Kurast. I haven’t been there for several years, but rumor has it that things are pretty grim.
    11. Tyrael: I thank you, mortal, for my freedom. But I did expect you earlier. I am the Archangel Tyrael. I came here to prevent Diablo from freeing his brother, Baal. But I have failed. Now, Terror and Destruction roam free throughout your world. Even now, they head towards the Eastern capital of Kurast – to the very heart of the Zakarum Temple. There they hope to find their eldest brother, Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred who was imprisoned there ages ago. If the three Prime Evils unite, they will be invincible. Though it is unclear as to what their aims are, it is certain that they must be stopped at all costs. I am broken and the energies that tie me to this world are diminishing rapidly. You must take up this quest and prevent the Three Brothers from reuniting. You must cross the sea and search for Diablo and Baal in Kurast. Now hurry, mortal… Time is running out for all of us!
    12. Warriv: Never fear, my friend. You did the best you could. I suspect that Diablo and Baal are now heading east, towards Kurast. You’ll find them… I know you will.
